What is IEA PVPS TCP?

The International Energy Agency (IEA), founded in 1974, is an autonomous body within the framework of the Organization for Economic

Cooperation and Development (OECD). The Technology Collaboration Programme (TCP) was created with a belief that the future of energy

security and sustainability starts with global collaboration. The programme is made up of 6.000 experts across government, academia, and

industry dedicated to advancing common research and the application of specific energy technologies.

The IEA Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme (IEA PVPS) is one of the TCP’s within the IEA and was established in 1993. The mission

of the programme is to ‘enhance the international collaborative efforts which facilitate the role of photovoltaic solar energy as a cornerstone

in the transition to sustainable energy systems’. In order to achieve this, the Programme’s participants have undertaken a variety of joint

research projects in PV power systems applications. The overall programme is headed by an Executive Committee, comprised of one dele-

gate from each country or organisation member, which designates distinct ‘Tasks’, that may be research projects or activity areas.

The IEA PVPS participating countries are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Israel,

Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Morocco, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkiye,

and the United States of America. The European Commission, Solar Power Europe and the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore

are also members.

What is IEA PVPS Task 13?

Within the framework of IEA PVPS, Task 13 aims to provide support to market actors working to improve the operation, the reliability and the

quality of PV components and systems. Operational data from PV systems in different climate zones compiled within the project will help

provide the basis for estimates of the current situation regarding PV reliability and performance.

The general setting of Task 13 provides a common platform to summarize and report on technical aspects affecting the quality, performance,

reliability and lifetime of PV systems in a wide variety of environments and applications. By working together across national boundaries, we

can  all  take  advantage  of research  and  experience  from  each  member  country  and  combine  and  integrate  this knowledge  into  valuable

summaries of best practices and methods for ensuring PV systems perform at their optimum and continue to provide competitive return on

investment.

Task 13 has so far managed to create the right framework for the calculations of various parameters that can give an indication of the quality

of PV components and systems. The framework is now there and can be used by the industry who has expressed appreciation towards the

results included in the high-quality reports.

The IEA PVPS countries participating in Task 13 are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,

Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, the United States of America, and the Solar Energy

Research Institute of Singapore.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of photovoltaic applications depends on, among other
things, the performance, price and durability of the photovoltaic (PV) module. Performance and
price can be determined with little effort. Durability is the least known of these three factors. In
this report, we evaluate the impact of degradation/failure modes of innovations in the market.

The  reliability  situation  of  Tunnel  Oxide  Passivated  Contact  (TOPCon)  and  Silicon  Hetero-
Junction (SHJ) is shown in Figure 1 for selected degradation and failure modes. Especially
semiconductor-related  degradation  modes  show  degradation  and  recovery  paths:  light (and
elevated temperature)-induced degradation (LeTID/LID), UV-induced degradation (UVID), and
potential-induced degradation (PID). Their impact can only be assessed if the degradation and
recovery paths are understood, and a test method is available. Common degradation modes
or failures related to embedment, glass and junction box are shown in Figure 1 on the right.
Current standard tests, especially of the IEC 61215 standard, cannot reveal these degradation
or failure modes. As these modes are safety relevant, it is important to understand the causes
and develop standardized tests to identify these reliability problems.

Figure  1:  Overview  of  test  availability  and  impact  of  currently  relevant  degradation
modes of TOPCon and SHJ module designs.

In the following we go through degradation modes which changed with new innovation. We
find that the impact of cell cracking has been mostly overcome by the innovation of multi-wire
technology. Also, LID/LeTID has been well understood and solved by switching from Boron to
Gallium as a dopant for Si-wafers, by using adjusted processes in the cell production together
with  the  use  of  thin  wafers,  and  lowering  the  number  of  impurities  in  the  wafer  production.
Furthermore, standard test procedures are available, so that the LID/LeTID impact on long-
term performance can be tested even for innovation. The degradation mechanisms which lay
behind PID can be triggered and mitigated at cell, module and system level. These degradation
mechanisms are caused by high system voltage and may be influenced by light, in particular
UV irradiation. PID tests for modules with Passivated Emitter and Rear Totally diffused (PERT)
cells have shown that additional light during a PID test can effectively prevent degradation. It
has been shown in one case that an UV irradiance equivalent to the UV content in the standard
AM1.5 spectrum at 1000 Wm-² can reduce the PID effect for a module with TOPCon cells to
below 3%. In contrast, in this case no UV irradiation during the PID test leads to a degradation
of 28%. For PV modules with SHJ cells a new potential PID degradation mechanism is identi-
fied. However, no PID affected modules are found in the field corresponding to this mode, yet.

Task 13 Reliability and Performance of Photovoltaic Systems – Degradation and Failure Modes in New Photocoltaic Cell and Module Technologies

To  assess  the  irradiation  impact  on  real  installations,  the  upcoming  PID  standard  IEC
TS 62804-1 (2025) offers a combined potential and light test procedure.

In  some  solar  modules  with  TOPCon  and  SHJ  cells,  UVID  is  pronounced  after accelerated
aging tests. It is still unclear whether the degradation can be reversed by outdoor exposure
and how the test can be transferred from laboratory to field, since many interacting mecha-
nisms influence UV degradation and recovery. It must be emphasized that the UVID is a solv-
able problem, since some modules in accelerated tests are UV-stable. The reflection or ab-
sorption of UV radiation before it reaches the c-Si/passivation interfaces (e.g. by the encapsu-
lation material) can mitigate the UVID.

For encapsulant materials standardized PV module tests (e.g., of the IEC 61215 series or other
PV safety standards) often do not reveal relevant degradation paths as their focus is on the
electrical performance of the PV modules and not on the polymer materials stability. Therefore,
many PV modules are found in the field with damaged lamination material. Combined stresses
with  e.g.  temperature  change,  humidity  and  UV  radiation  can  reveal  these  polymer-related
degradation  paths.  Especially  for  these  degradation  modes,  new  combined  aging  tests  are
required as discussed in detail in the IEA PVPS TASK 13 sister report “Accelerated testing -
combined  stress  vs.  sequential  stress  testing  methods  and  inclusion  of  specific  load  situa-
tions”. As degradation of encapsulation material is not recoverable and often leads to safety
issues, these additional tests are recommended for new encapsulant materials.

In practice, thin glass (thickness ≤ 2 mm) used in new glass/glass modules sometimes results
in unpredictable high glass breakage rates. In documented cases 5% to 10% of the module
rear  glasses  broke  in  the  first  two  years  after  installation.  The  mechanical  load  test  in
IEC 61215 cannot reveal this vulnerability, as it would need parallel tests on tens of modules,
instead of only one, to assess the failure rate. Currently, only a high number of tests in the final
mounting position can reveal the stability of thin glass modules.

More frequently than before, it happens that electrical contacts in the junction boxes are not
soldered correctly. This may mean that the bypass diodes (BPDs) are not properly contacted.
Faults in the junction box can lead to fires and power losses in entire module strings. However,
unconnected BPDs are difficult to detect in PV systems that have already been installed. It is
therefore recommended to check the function of 100% of the BPDs during production. A PV
system  installation  should  be  100%  tested  if  there  are  indications  that  this type of  failure  is
occurring in the selected modules.

This report also includes a concise summary on the reliability of metal halide perovskite (MHP)-
based PV modules according to the current scientific literature. There are many known degra-
dation paths for which remedies exist at the conceptual or laboratory level. For example, pro-
tective encapsulation against UV radiation, moisture and oxygen basically helps to stabilize
the perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, besides others, two prominent challenges are the
temperature and the ion migration stability. The limited temperature stability and the high ion
mobility lead to unsolved degradation paths under normal operation conditions like shading
and high system voltage. There are new degradation modes in tandem solar cells with MHPs.
For example, the reverse voltage states occurring in the top and bottom cells during shaded
conditions depend on the irradiation spectrum and cannot yet be reproduced by standard qual-
ification tests. New tests addressing this shading condition are important to evaluate new deg-
radation pathways that do not occur in single junction PV modules.

To produce reliable PV modules, all degradation pathways must be understood and mitigated
in one solution. There are currently no comprehensive solutions in the literature to address the
multiple reliability issues of PSCs.

Task 13 Reliability and Performance of Photovoltaic Systems – Degradation and Failure Modes in New Photocoltaic Cell and Module Technologies

  INTRODUCTION

The previous IEA PVPS reports on PV module failures [1], their assessment [2] and quantifi-
cation of technical risks [3] are still relevant documents for assessing and mitigating of degra-
dations  and  failures  in  PV  modules.  A  degradation  mode  is  an  observable  specific  change
mechanism of a PV module like it is defined by Jordan et al. [4] that can (but does not have to)
lead to a failure mode. For the word “failure” we use the definition from Köntges et al. [1] where
a failure in a PV module means that the power warranty of a module is no longer fulfilled or the
safety of a PV system is affected. A failure mode is a specific type of failure. With this document
we like to target a broad audience starting from cell and module manufactures up to PV system
owners.  As  in  the  former  reports,  we  strongly  focus  on  Si-wafer-based  solar  modules  here.
However, the PV module technology has developed fast. This document aims to give an up-
date of degradation mechanisms and currently important failures in current PV cell and module
technologies.

Chapter 2 therefore presents in-depth information on degradation mechanisms and potential
mitigation strategies on production level. We start with degradation mechanisms (cell cracks,
LID, LeTID) which had been important in the former review but lost importance within current
(2023) PV module products. Thereafter, we present degradation modes which are still relevant
for  PV  module  technologies  (PID,  substring  protection  and  module  embedment)  and  which
show specific differences to former reviews mentioned above. At the end of chapter 2 we an-
alyse degradation modes which are specifically relevant for the current cell technologies TOP-
Con and SHJ. This breaks the strict sorting along degradation and failure modes but allows
the reader to quickly read about all special degradation modes for TOPCon and SHJ. All chap-
ters contain an explanation of the degradation mode, its impact on module/system level, how
to identify it, how to test it, and if possible, how to mitigate the degradation mode. All sections
contain numerous up-to-date references to the most relevant publications, if additional infor-
mation is needed.

Due to the rapidly growing development of MHP-based solar cells and modules, we report in
chapter 3 on their known degradation modes and existing mitigation strategies. Chapter 3 is
addressed to the scientific interested reader as all available data is extracted from scientific
publications. We have no information on degradation modes of market available MHP-based
modules.

In  the  previous  IEA  PVPS  Task  13  report  by  Herz  et  al.  [3]  PV-related  failures  have  been
collected and systematised in Photovoltaic Failure Fact Sheets (PVFS) for the first time. For
the application related reader these PVFS have been updated with the content of this work
and can be downloaded as a separate document from the IEA PVPS website area [5]. These
fact sheets explain all needed information for the application, such as how to detect a failure
or degradation, information on safety and power production, and how to mitigate the problem
if possible. Unfortunately, not all degradation and failure modes have been transferred to the
PVFS,  as  there  is  not  always enough  material  available  to  visualise  the  failure  and  provide
clear recommendations for action. Especially for MHP-based solar cells and modules no PVFS
exists, yet.

  DEGRADATION  AND  FAILURE  MODES
TECHNOLOGIES ENTERED THE MARKET

IN  RECENT

Photovoltaic module technologies and their application profiles evolve with time. As the deg-
radation  modes  are  always  related  to  technologies  and  their  application  profile  they  also
change with time. The testing sequences defined by the International Electrotechnical Com-
mission (IEC) in the IEC 61215 series standard [6] are a good way to assess that new tech-
nologies degrade slow enough in the application. However, testing is always a compromise
between finding failures and test simplification. The test simplification may lead to false positive
or false negative results for new technologies. One prominent example is the PID of PERT
cells which may degrade in a PID test under dark conditions, but under realistic conditions the
sunlight compensates for the PID effect, so the degradation is not relevant in the application.

In the following, we discuss if the most relevant degradation mechanisms already described in
previous  PVPS  TASK 13  reports  [1],  [2]  which  are  changed  due  to  new  innovations.  After-
wards, we discuss new technologies, the knowledge about their degradation modes, and their
relevance for the application.

2.1  Cut Si wafer-based cell cracking and multi-wire design

The cutting of Si wafer-based cells in half cells or 1/3rd cells increases the risk of cracking at
the cutting cell edge when preparing modules from the cells. Cutting of Si cells into half or even
in one third by a laser ablation process introduces small micro cracks into the groove area of
the laser ablation process. Hwang et al. shows that with increasing crack opening width in the
laser groove surface, the break force needed to break the cells in a 4-point bending test de-
creases [7]. They also show that the number of broken cells in a module increases with in-
creasing micro crack opening in the laser groove surface. Module power measurements after
a mechanical load test show that the number of cracked cells and the power loss increases
with the crack opening in the laser groove. For multi-wire solar modules, the power loss due
to cell cracks is reduced compared to former ribbon-based modules. Hwang et al. show 0.2%
power loss per dendritic-like cracked half-cell for a multi-wire Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell
(PERC) cell in the module [7]. For a relevant power loss of 5% one needs about 25 dendritic-
like  cracked  cells.  So,  cell  cracks  still  influence  the  module  power  for  multi-wire  connected
halved cells, but the final impact on the module power is low. Thermal laser separation method
can be used to reduce cell cracking in cut solar cells compared to laser ablation method [8].

Figure 2 a) shows that small cracks induced at the cut edge may already exist after production.
They are ignored at this stage but frequently grow into dendritic cracks during transportation
and installation, as well as mechanical loads and temperature variations that may occur in the
field. Figure 2 b) shows the electroluminescence (EL) image of one of these glass/backsheet
modules tested on arrival at the installation site.

The same batch of modules was delivered to two different sites and an EL inspection of 50
modules was performed on arrival at each site. The defects are categorised as major defects
when dendritic cracks are found, simple branch cracks are categorised as minor defects, and
few single cracks are categorised as normal.

At one site the defect rate was 78% major, 18% minor and 4% normal, whereas at the other
site the defect rate was 70% major, 30% minor, and no normal modules. Dendritic cracks per
cell result only in ~0.2% of power loss in the module. However, this kind of cracks can occur

11

Task 13 Reliability and Performance of Photovoltaic Systems – Degradation and Failure Modes in New Photocoltaic Cell and Module Technologies

with a high proportion of cells in the module and the total power loss could be noticeable, but
very small for PV systems.

For glass/glass modules the cell crack occurrence is typically very low. To our best knowledge,
all papers on PV module degradation caused by cell cracks are based on 2 to 4 cell intercon-
nect  ribbons  per  cell  with  full  cell  module  design.  In  this  way,  according  to  our  present
knowledge, no field degradation data on cut cell and multi-wire designs are available.

Figure 2: a) Cracks induced at the edge of laser cutting during module production. b)
The cell cracks appeared after transportation while they were not seen in the final EL
inspection in the module production line. The current inactive cell areas are below
5% per cell.

2.2  Light-induced degradation

In recent times, light-induced degradation phenomena had been a large effect on some multi-
crystalline and PERC-based solar cell types. Therefore, through this chapter we discuss the
relevance  of  new  developments  in  wafer  and  cell  technology  regarding  to  the  light-induced
degradation modes.

2.2.1  Boron related light-induced degradation

Light-induced degradation is the phenomenon of cell and module power degradation due to
incident light. The main degradation mechanism is based on the formation of Boron-Oxygen
complexes  (B-O  LID)  and  was  particularly  strong  in  Czochralski-grown  Si  mono-crystalline
cells, in part due to its high oxygen concentration [9]. The maximum degradation of LID typically
happens within the first few hours of light exposure and it may amount to several percent rel-
ative  to  the  initial  module  performance.  After  the  degradation  phase,  a  slow  recovery  can
sometimes be observed upon further operation, which is often difficult to quantify in the field,
because it is superimposed by other degradation or weather effects.

In recent years, the prevalence and severity of LID in PV modules has dropped significantly
due to the usage of Ga instead of B as dopant in p-type cells. In theory this exchange removes
the possibility to form B-O complexes due to the absence of B atoms. Nevertheless, LID may
still  be  observed  in  Ga-doped  p-type  [10]  and  even  in  n-type  cells  [11],  due  to  B  impurities
present in the wafers. Due to the generally low number of impurities (B and Fe) in today's Si
wafer the relevance of LID is low for nearly all current PV modules based on Ga p-type and n-
type doping.

2.2.2  Light and elevated temperature-induced degradation

Light and elevated temperature-induced degradation (LeTID) is a degradation mechanism that
mainly affects p-type PERC modules. The exact mechanism is linked to hydrogen-related de-
fects, which become active under the combined thermal and light stress conditions, causing
minority charge carrier recombination and therewith reduced power output. Regeneration oc-
curs when the defects responsible for degradation are gradually passivated under controlled
thermal or electrical conditions. This process typically involves the redistribution and reactiva-
tion of hydrogen, leading to the recovery of cell efficiency over time. Due to its degradation-
regeneration behaviour through the first years of operation, it can lead to significant yield loss
in field operation (sometime reaching values over 10%). Similarly to LID, a regeneration phase,
that is largely influenced by weather and seasonal effects, can be observed in the years after
the maximum degradation has been reached [12], [13].

Based on a mechanistic understanding of the underlying phenomena, involving hydrogen dif-
fusion from the cell surface and defect formation in the bulk, mitigation strategies for cell pro-
duction, such as adapting temperature profiles in the firing process [14], [15] or using thinner
wafers [16], have been developed in recent years. Furthermore, the transition from Boron- to
Gallium doping in p-type solar cells led to a decrease in LeTID [17].

According to current experience, modules containing n-type  TOPCon cells are substantially
less susceptible to LeTID than early p-doped PERC cells.

The above-explained reasonings for LID and LeTID have been demonstrated in the following
experiment, where a large selection of commercial TOPCon modules was subjected to 322
hours of LeTID tests (IEC TS 63342:2022 for 2 × 162 h at ISC – IMPP) after LID preconditioning
(IEC 61215-2:2021 gate 1), see Figure 3. The results show minor effects on the PV module
performance.

Figure 3: Performance loss (PMPP) of commercial TOPCon modules after 322 hours of
LeTID tests [18].

At PV module and PV system level we expect no detectable degradation from the LeTID effect
in current TOPCon modules based on Ga doped p-type wafers.

2.3  Potential-induced degradation

System voltage potential-induced degradation (PID) involves electric charge transfer through
the encapsulation of PV modules to or from the cell. Depending on the module type, the polarity
and level of the voltage potential, which develops according to voltage difference between the
cells in the module and ground, and environmental factors, a number of different PID modes
may manifest.

The known and documented PID modes are summarised by Molto et al. [19] and listed in the
following:

PID-Corrosion involves electrochemical reactions at the cell surface, including the metalliza-
tion, the dielectric, and the Si itself. Chemical species within the cell and encapsulation disso-
ciate and drift under the applied electric field.

PID-Delamination involves electrochemical reactions at the cell surface which produce gase-
ous products leading to delamination of encapsulants. The process may also involve the pre-
cipitation of ions at interfaces that promote delamination.

PID-Penetration involves drift of Na+ or other ions that migrate to the cell circuit, penetrating
the passivating dielectric, including at pinholes, depositing on the Si surface, and leading to
degrading surface passivation which reduces photocurrent and voltage.

PID-Polarisation  (PID-p)  involves  motion  of  charge  into  or  out  of  the  dielectric  passivation
layers in such a manner that more minority carriers are attracted to the interface of the Si with
the passivating dielectric. This leads to reduced photocurrent and voltage. There may be sev-
eral mechanisms responsible for PID-p. The charged species may be a static charge, which
can be dissipated by UV irradiation due to photoconductivity in the dielectric, or, speculatively,
an elemental ion with a charge that is not dissipated by UV irradiation.

PID-Shunting involves migration of ions, particularly Na+ from the glass and encapsulant, but
also from cell production handling, drifting to the cell surface and dielectric, and then diffusing
through defects through the emitter of the cell, leading to junction recombination and shunting.

PID-Shunting has already been addressed in former PVPS TASK 13 reports and has not been
observed in current cell types. PID-Delamination occurs very rare in the field and is usually
mitigated  when  other  PID-mechanisms  are  solved  with  higher  resistivity  encapsulation  and
there is little information in the literature. PID-Corrosion is no new degradation mechanism and
no  field-related  cases  for  current  crystalline  silicon  solar  modules  are  reported  in  literature.
PID-Penetration is a process appearing after or together with other PID mechanism or it occurs
at harsh test conditions. Among all these PID modes, PID-p is the most relevant, emerging,
degradation  mode  for  current  cell  types  [19].  Therefore,  we  focus  on  this  mode  in  the  next
chapters.

2.3.1  Potential-induced degradation by polarisation on cell rear of bifacial PERC

solar cells

The rear side of bifacial PERC solar cells, which have a structure from front to back consisting
of anti-reflective coating (ARC)/n+/p/ARC, is particularly susceptible to PID-p because there is
no diffused surface field repelling minority carrier electrons there, except at the localised cell
contacts. The rear ARC dielectric may consist of a stack including AlOx, SiOx, or SiNx. AlOx
deposited in the dielectric is preferably deposited to contain a negative charge that serves to
repel the minority carrier electrons in the p-doped cell base. However, when the cell circuit is
negatively biased, positively charged species can drift through the rear encapsulation towards

14

Task 13 Reliability and Performance of Photovoltaic Systems – Degradation and Failure Modes in New Photocoltaic Cell and Module Technologies

the dielectric stack. That net positive charge developing in the rear increasingly attracts minor-
ity  carrier  electrons  in  the  p-type  base  towards  the  rear  dielectric,  resulting  in  an  increased
effective  surface  recombination  velocity,  see  Figure  4.  This  mechanism  results  in  a  loss  of
photogenerated carriers, which reduces the photocurrent and the voltage of the cell, especially
if the power is measured by light-current-voltage (light-IV) characteristics from the rear.

Figure 4: Schematic of the PID-p process in the PERC module rear. The red arrows
indicate the motion of current (positive charge) through the encapsulation.

In recent times, there has been a migration to higher sheet resistance of the n-type emitter on
the front face of the cell. This transition has been achieved using methods such as selective
emitters or Ag grid finger metallization, which enable contact with higher sheet resistance front
emitters. While front ARC usually is based on some combination of SiO2 and SiNx layers, where
SiNx  has  a  built-in  positive  charge,  placing  the  cells  in  a  positive  bias  which  can  lead  to
transport phenomena resulting in more negative charge in the front. This process increasingly
attracts minority carrier holes in the front emitter and more front surface recombination. Fur-
ther, PID-shunting becomes more probable if the junction depth of that emitter is shallower.
Since the rear side is weakly doped and usually receives less light, it has less photoconductivity
in the SiNx layer to counteract PID-causing charge. As a result, the rear side is more sensitive
to PID-p than the front side, although the front side also has a certain sensitivity.

Several studies have demonstrated PID-p degradation under laboratory conditions. Since the
rear side of the cell has weak doping and is therefore more sensitive, it has received greater
attention in research studies. An example of the degradation magnitude of PID-p when effec-
tuated on the module rear is shown in Figure 5.  It can be seen that the degradation magnitude
of PID-p is much greater for light I-V testing from the rear than such testing with illumination
incident on the front of the module, because the photogenerated carriers are largely generated
close  to  the  rear  surface  where  increased  recombination  takes  place.  As  the  stress  testing
duration increases, a recovery in power output is observed. This is attributed to inversion at
the rear surface, where the silicon base effectively becomes n-type [20], [21].

Figure 5: Normalized IV curve parameter of bifacial PERC modules with Ethylene-Vi-
nyl-Acetate (EVA) encapsulant as function of test duration when biased with -1000 V
applied to the cells and the rear glass face grounded. The values are obtained by
flash testing under standard test conditions (25°C, 1000 W/m2) and under 200 W/m2
from the front and rear as indicated in the figures. Values are from the averages of 3
samples. The solid lines are visual guides. The figure is redrawn from Luo et al. [20].

Several studies point to the existence of PID-p in PERC modules under field stress conditions.
Combined-accelerated stress testing using the extremes of the natural environment (temper-
ature cycles, irradiation and at the same time system voltage, dynamic and static load, low and
high  humid  conditions  together  with  water  spray),  indicated  that  PERC  cells  in  glass/glass
modules  with  EVA  encapsulation  on  the  front  and  rear  side  exhibited  PID-p  [22].  Although
there was convolution with a much lesser amount of LID, with -1200 V bias voltage applied
between the cell circuit and the module frame during periods of illumination (including about
7.5% albedo in the UV range), there was almost 10% relative degradation when flash tested
from the front and more than 50% degradation when flash tested from the rear at standard test
conditions associated with PID-p on the rear [22].

For testing PID-p in the field, commercial bifacial glass/glass PERC modules with EVA encap-
sulant were put in two different mounting configurations. One mounting is near (0.3 m) ground
with small insolation and one is an open rack (2 m) above ground with higher rear insulation

16

Task 13 Reliability and Performance of Photovoltaic Systems – Degradation and Failure Modes in New Photocoltaic Cell and Module Technologies

and  with  their  maximum  rated  system  voltage  of  -1500  V  or  +1500  V  bias  during  the  day.
Modules in open racks, either close to ground or elevated in open racks with -1500 V exhibited
PID-p within several weeks whereas modules with +1500 V did not exhibit such degradation,
see Figure 6.

Figure 6: Normalized power to control sample for outdoor PID stress testing of
PERC modules on two different racks with +1500 V and -1500 V system voltage be-
tween cells and rack in Cocoa, Florida USA (Cfa climate in Köppen Geiger classifica-
tion 2006). Measured points are assembled from three samples per rack type. The
figure is redrawn from Hacke et al. [23].

PID-p  may  be  partially  mitigated  by  inclusion  of  SiOx  in  the  rear  dielectric  stack  (i.e.
AlOx/SiOx/SiNx) [24]. The use of a more resistive encapsulant such as a polyolefin (PO)-con-
taining encapsulant rather than EVA and/or a polymeric backsheet instead of glass are more
certain  mitigations  [20]. Ultimately,  testing  the  module  simultaneously  with  voltage  bias  and
light with UV content, is helpful to understand whether PID-p will be a problem in the field [25].

Testing for PID in crystalline Si (c-Si)-based modules has been done with the two methods
described in the standard IEC 62804-1 (2015) [26]. Stress method (a), testing in an environ-
mental chamber, employs a non-condensing humidity level to serve as a conductive pathway
to electrical ground. It frequently applies less stress toward the centre of the module face and
the PID effect is concentrated toward the module edges, as is often observed for PID in PV
systems. The testing conditions are module temperature of 60°C or, for further acceleration,
65°C and 85°C which is most commonly used and adopted in IEC 61215 series (2021) [6], the
design qualification and type approval test. Further test conditions are the chamber relative
humidity (RH) of 85%, the duration of 96 hours, the module rated system voltage, and polarity
applied during the test.

Stress method (b) consists of contacting the surfaces with a grounded conductive electrode. It
evaluates cell sensitivity and some effects of the component embedment materials such as
glass and encapsulant resistivity, but does not differentiate the effects of some construction
methods  of  mitigating  PID,  such  as  the  use  of  rear  rail  mounts,  edge  clips,  and  insulating
frames. Severities prescribed are test temperature of 25°C or, if further acceleration is desired,
50°C or 60°C, RH less than 60%, a dwell duration of 168 hours, module rated system voltage,
and the polarities applied during the test period.

17

Task 13 Reliability and Performance of Photovoltaic Systems – Degradation and Failure Modes in New Photocoltaic Cell and Module Technologies

For testing PID-p, illumination of the sample is recommended. In IEC 62804-1 (2025) [27], two
methods  are  given  to  provide  a  transparent  conductive  electrode  for  the  module  face  with
which an electric field is applied while allowing the transmission of UV irradiation. Method (c)
uses an electrolyte gel serving as an electrode for the module face that is covered by a UV-
transparent polymeric film, to reduce evaporation of the gel. The alternative method (d) uses
a fine metal mesh weighed down by a UV transparent sheet on the module face to transmit
UV irradiation and serve as an electrode for the module face. The test temperature is 60°C,
the duration 20 hours, with the module rated system voltage and polarities. For testing on the
superstrate side, 3.0 W/m2 in the range of 290 nm to 400 nm irradiation level is prescribed. For
testing on the substrate side, the measured UV irradiance level incident on the module rear,
or by default if not measured, 0.3 W/m2 in the range of 290 nm to 400 nm is prescribed. The
UV light irradiation spectrum is defined in IEC 61215-2 MQT 10 [28], in the UV preconditioning
test.

As a diagnostic measure of extent of possible PID-p recoverability under a standard level of
irradiance, an additional test is included in IEC TS 62804-1 (2025) [27] with a level of irradiance
for front surfaces of modules of 100 W/m2 in the range of 290 nm to 400 nm with irradiance
source specified in IEC 61215-2 MQT 10 [28] and a module temperature of 60°C.

The test procedures described here may be used for the cell types described below, but the
relationships between the PID test and field behaviour for SHJ-based modules have not been
explored.

2.3.2  Potential-induced degradation by polarisation on PERT and TOPCon front

and rear side

PERT and TOPCon solar cells are grouped together based on their common structure of p+/n
cell doping on the cell front, see Figure 7. Due to the relatively lower solubilities of the boron
forming the p+ emitter region of the cell and the relatively reduced front surface field provided
by that doping compared to the n+/p fronts of PERC and Al-back surface field cells, the sensi-
tivity to the polarisation is elevated. When the cells experience negative voltage potential, pos-
itive charge drifts through the encapsulation to the front cell dielectric. In turn, minority carrier
electrons in the front p+ emitter tend to recombine more actively at the front surface, attracted
by  that  developing  positive  charge  in  the  front  dielectric.  Rear  sides  of  PERT  and  TOPCon
have significant phosphorus n+ doping, also in polysilicon the case of TOPCon, so the rear of
these devices is correspondingly found to be less sensitive to polarisation [25], [29], although
it is important to check as each module type shows different PID behaviour.

These cell types have significantly evolved over time. For example, the PERT type which came
on the market earlier in time, tended to have SiNx/SiO2 front passivation stacks. Later module
types added AlOx films to the stack, which have a built-in negative charge. This charge repels
minority carrier electrons in the emitter, reducing sensitivity to PID-p [30].

Figure 7: Schematic of the PID-p process in one manifestation of the PERT module
front (the front ARC stack may differ, including with the use of AlOx). The red arrows
indicate the motion of current (positive charge) through the encapsulation. The
mechanism is the same for the TOPCon front (which has an SiOx/n-type polysili-
con/SiNx rear side instead of what is shown here for a PERT module).

For PERT cell modules, there are several studies where extremely rapid degradation has been
measured; for example, in the dark [31], and while varying the level of full spectrum illumination
and encapsulant resistivity [32].  Figure 8 shows the relative degradation in cell parameters as
PID-p occurs. PID-p in the case of a single cell consists of the loss in open-circuit voltage (VOC)
and short circuit current (ISC), but a negligible change in fill factor (FF). Overall, this results in
the loss of maximum power (Pmpp).

single cell modules as function of the duration of PID stress. The voltage bias and
temperature in the PID tests are set to −1000 V and 85°C, respectively. The data
points represent the mean values of three identical single cell modules and the solid
lines are visual guides. The figure is redrawn from Yamaguchi et al. [31].

High resistivity encapsulants and the generally high level of front side radiation reduce PID-p
effects  for  PERT  and  TOPCon  solar  modules.  Figure  9  shows  how  increased  levels  of  the
encapsulant resistivity and illumination with the module surface maintained wet lead to a re-
duction of PID-p. In these modules the degradation occurs regardless of the irradiation using
this low resistivity EVA encapsulant. Conversely, even the most resistant encapsulations will
exhibit PID-p if they are kept under voltage stress in the dark for long enough.

testing (triangles) and in situ (circles) during PID testing. Different coloured circles
mark in situ measurements that were taken on each of three samples running at the
respective illumination level. Thereby, 60°C and -1000 V were applied to the cells
and the front glass face grounded. Resistivity in Ω·cm for the encapsulant Polyole-
fin elastomer (POE) A 1.2x1016, POE B 3.8x1014, POE C 8.5x1013, and EVA 1.1x1013
[32].

For PERT modules tested outdoors, it has been reported that degradation occurs during peri-
ods of wet weather, when the module surface becomes conductive and facilitates coulombic
charge transfer across the glass between the cell circuit and the ground, while there is a lack
of full sunlight. However, after periods of sunny weather, the power of the modules is at least
partially restored, see Figure 10.

tion of the indoor (red) and outdoor (blue/orange) PID test duration at a voltage of

from PID-p mode to PID-shunting mode. The open blue and filled orange square data
points indicate the results for the outdoor PID test in or just after rainy and sunny
days, respectively. The figure is redrawn from Ohdaira et al. [33].

TOPCon modules with EVA encapsulation show a maximum of ~3% PID p-front degradation
with -1000 V applied to the solar cells and the glass rear face with the front glass face grounded
in a test setup for the polarisation of the p+/n front structure over 96 hours in humid and cloudy
(~0.1  sun)  weather.  However,  under  0.1-sun-equivalent  level  with  UVA  illumination  corre-
sponding to 0.051 W·m−2 nm−1 at 340 nm, they show progressively less degradation, see Fig-
ure 11. The cell rear side did not show any PID effect in that study [25].

cording to ASTM G173-03 contains 0.502 W·m-2·nm-1 at 340 nm. Two repetitions were
performed per irradiance level shown with markers (●). The figure is redrawn from
Hacke et al. [25].

In the case of the TOPCon module tested, the PID-p rapidly and repeatedly recovers under
sunlight when the voltage potential across the front glass is removed. Such properties suggest
that PID-p will rapidly recover in the field and that it may not even occur to any significant extent
because solar irradiation is accompanied by the development of system voltage stress in the
module string. However, the relative sensitivity to PID-p under the factors of system voltage
and solar irradiation must be checked for each module type.

2.4  Protection of substrings in the modules

The protection of the module’s substrings against acting as a power load is one of the most
important safety features of a solar module. A module can act as a power load if it is partially
shaded or if there is high resistive interruption due to a failure in the electric current path (sub-
string). There are two widely used options to protect a module’s substring against high power
dissipation during shading. The cheapest and most commonly used option is to protect a sub-
string against overheating by a bypass diode (BPD). The second option is to avoid overheating
during shading is by using solar cells with a low, not localised breakthrough, voltage which acts
similar as a cell-wise BPD. Even in the second case, an additional BPD per string, is used to
reduce the power loss during excessive shading, and to achieve an additional safety feature
in the event of a high resistive interruption in the module’s substring. With current module types
(1500 V and 600 Wp) 10 kW and more can be generated in a single module string. The higher
the string power, the more harmful a failure of the substring protection can be.

2.4.1  Hot cells

Cell cracking or shading of PV modules can cause current mismatch and reverse bias voltages
in underperforming solar cells, causing the cells to dissipate power and generate heat. The
difference between the well-known hot spot and the hot cell effect is that the hot spot is mainly
associated with multicrystalline silicon solar cells and causes localised heat generation (local
junction breakdown), whereas the hot cell is associated with monocrystalline silicon solar cells
and causes a homogeneous temperature rise throughout the cell area [34]–[36], see Figure
12. The most important junction breakdown mechanism in monocrystalline silicon solar cells
is avalanche breakdown, which occurs at reverse bias voltages below -20 V for PERC cells
[37] and even more negative for TOPCon, SHJ, and possibly for MHP/Si tandem [36]. A hot
cell can cause heating above the typical module operating temperature of 50°C - 70°C, reach-
ing temperatures above the highest module’s lamination temperature of 150°C.

Figure 12: Temperature distribution of a partially shaded cell during the IEC 61215-
2 MQT 09 Hot-spot endurance test [28], [35]. The shadow mask is shading the cell
with a 4 cm wide cover strip.

The occurrence of a hot cell may lead to the generation of other failure modes, including dis-
colouration, interconnection failures, cell cracks, delamination, loss of electrical insulation, and
a permanent change in the reverse bias characteristics of a shaded cell [38]–[40]. The standard

24

Task 13 Reliability and Performance of Photovoltaic Systems – Degradation and Failure Modes in New Photocoltaic Cell and Module Technologies

hot-spot endurance test (IEC 61215-2:2021 MQT 09 [28]) assesses the ability of the solar cell
and module materials to withstand localised point heating at a module temperature of 55°C ±
15°C under worst-case partial shading.

PV manufacturers are taking measures to minimise the impact of hot cells on the reliability and
durability  of  PV  modules.  These  measures  include  sorting  cells  into  bins  based  on  the  cell
current rating and the screening of individual cells for low shunt resistance [41], [42]. In addi-
tion, manufacturers insert BPDs into PV modules to minimise the formation of hot cells and
mitigate their harmful consequences. The incorporation of the BPDs ensures that the power
dissipated by the shaded cell  is at most the power generated by the rest of the cells in the
same sub-string. This way, although BPDs can reduce the power losses caused by shadows,
they do not eliminate the negative effects of hot cells, which can still lead to significant perfor-
mance  losses  and  safety  risks  [43].  The  market  now  offers  a  variety  of  shade-resistant  PV
modules, such as half-cell modules, shingled modules, and modules with built-in diodes for
each cell [44]–[46]. However, the term "shade resistance" is poorly defined, and there is no
reliable way to compare different PV products. Researchers are working to standardise this,
focusing  primarily  on  minimising  yield  loss,  but  often  neglecting  improved  reliability  [47].  In
addition, decreasing the number of solar cells per BPD lowers the hot cell temperature, as it
operates at less negative reverse voltages [35], [36], [48].

In Interdigitated Back Contact (IBC) solar cells, the p+ and n+ regions can be designed to be in
direct contact with each other, resulting in the formation of a Zener diode that functions as a
built-in BPD and significantly lowers the breakdown voltage (> -5 V) of the cell [49], [50]. As
shown in [48], during the indoor hot-spot test, the hot cell temperature of the IBC module was
at most 25°C higher than the module temperature. Moreover, it was significantly lower than
the temperature of the PERC and SHJ module technologies under the same conditions, see
Figure 13.

Figure 13: Module and hot cell temperatures of PERC - half-cell  365 Wp, IBC - half-
cell 400 Wp and SHJ - half-cell 375 Wp modules from indoor hot spot tests per-
formed at 55°C module temperature by following IEC 61215-2:2021 [28], [48].

High temperatures above 150°C can have significant implications for polymeric materials (i.e.
discolouration, delamination, embrittlement [38], [51]), which are designed to operate below
this  temperature.  Furthermore,  temperatures  above  170°C  can  lead  to  bubbles  and  defor-
mation of the backsheet material, and in extreme cases, the junction box may even detach
[51]. It is also crucial to ensure that the temperature of the hot cell does not exceed the solder
melting  temperature,  which  leads  to  solder  joint  failures  [52].  The  liquidus  temperature  of
Sn63Pb37  solder  is  183°C  and  for  lead-free  solders  around  220°C  [35]. In  addition,  high  cell

25

Task 13 Reliability and Performance of Photovoltaic Systems – Degradation and Failure Modes in New Photocoltaic Cell and Module Technologies

temperatures can also put the glass at risk of breaking. IEC 61730-2 MST 21 temperature test
exposes the module to 1000 W/m2 sunlight until the temperature stabilized and the pass criteria
of the standard is that no measured temperature exceeds the limits of the surface materials.
This limit is given in the standard as “TI/RTE/RTI”, which is the maximum service temperature
at  which  the  critical  properties  of  a  material  will  remain  within  acceptable  limits  over  a  long
period of time. The duration spent at these high temperatures is as important as the tempera-
ture itself, as degradation mechanisms require time to occur. Thermoplastic materials require
a certain exposure duration to undergo material changes due to elevated temperatures.

Nowadays there is a clear trend towards bifacial modules, but their ability to receive light from
both sides can cause non-uniform illumination patterns at the rear side [53]. In the event of
current mismatch, the higher current produced by bifacial modules can result in higher hot cell
temperatures compared to monofacial modules [54]. Another current trend is the adoption of
half-cells, which are advantageous in terms of heat dissipation due to the larger perimeter-to-
area ratio. However, larger Si wafer dimensions decrease this ratio, resulting in higher hot cell
temperatures for modules using larger wafer formats [35]. Up to now, the hot cell effect occurs
in  the  standard  hot  spot  test,  but  not  as  severely  in  the  field.  Nevertheless,  increasing  the
substring  length  and  increasing  cell  efficiency  raises  the  risk  of  encountering  modules  with
laminate defects caused by regular shading in the field.

2.4.2  Unreliable connection in junction box

A reliable connection between the inner parts of a PV module and the BPD is mandatory. A
working BPD  and a  reliable connection  of the inner cell strings is responsible to avoid high
power dissipation on shaded cells in a PV module. A defect in the BPD or in the connection
process can often lead to arcs in the module laminate, which may cause a fire. This can result
in  the  loss  of  both  the  mechanical  and  electrical  integrity  of  the  module.  In  addition,  power
losses can occur in the entire string, either while the module is shaded or after the disintegra-
tion of the affected module. Therefore, this kind of failure type is one of the worst possible.
The half-cell module type, introduced around 2020 as a mainstream module layout, is accom-
panied by changes in the interconnection of inner parts and the diode box. Compared to former
full-cell modules, the substring interconnects of half-cell modules are very short at the point
where  they  lead  into  the  junction  box.  This  may  cause  an  unwanted  surface  contamination
onto the ends of the short substring interconnect from the lamination material during the lami-
nation process. Furthermore, it is more difficult to reach the interconnect ends by factory work-
ers/robots as they are now in the middle of the module and not near the frame. Additionally,
the diode boxes are quite small. In the past, most connections were made by reliable clamping
in  the  junction  box.  Nowadays  soldering  is  used  as  the  space  in  the  boxes  is  too  small  for
clamping. Furthermore, since then the diode boxes are filled with a filler material as a standard.
With  all  these  modifications  lamination  material  contamination  on  the  interconnection  wires
can cause a bad electric contact in the junction box, the difficult handling could cause a poor
quality/bad visual quality control of the soldering process, and the filler material can cause the
loosening of a weak connection in the diode box by shrinkage or by chemical changes.

If there are unreliable connections in the junction box, modules show connection failures in the
junction box within one and two years of installation in the field. The experience is that the rate
of  new  failures  per  year  drops  down  fast  in  the  second  year  for  one  installation.  Figure  14
shows an overview which failure modes (A, B, C) are possible, how to detect them, and what
consequences the failure mode provokes for the safety risk and the power loss. In Figure 14,
the consequences are given for the extreme case that the cold solder joints are fully discon-
nected. All shown failure modes can happen in all thinkable combinations. Failing BPD [55]
cannot be differentiated from failure mode A without a destructive analysis of the junction box.

26

Task 13 Reliability and Performance of Photovoltaic Systems – Degradation and Failure Modes in New Photocoltaic Cell and Module Technologies

However, having a mixture of failure modes A and B in a fleet of modules indicates that a cold
solder joint is the cause of the defect.

Figure 14: Failure modes of unreliable connections in separated junction boxes.
Open-circuit (OC) substrings or module strings appear 5-10 K hotter in IRT inspec-
tion compared to active strings.

However, as long as the likelihood of a cold solder joint is low, a combination of different fail-
ures  in  the  same  module  is  very  unlikely.  Failure  mode  A  can  occur  at four  different  solder
joints. Two of four solder joints are in the middle substring. Failure mode B can occur at two
possible joints, whereas failure mode C needs two joints failing in parallel. Therefore, failure
mode A occurs at least double as likely as failure mode B. Failure mode A cannot be detected
by infrared thermography (IRT) inspection, but failure mode B and C can. This means that if
failure mode B or even C is present, failure mode A is very likely to occur at a rate at least
twice as high as that of failure mode B. However, without shade on the modules failure mode
A will stay without notice. A shaded module with failure mode A can heat up very quickly (within
seconds) and may char or even burn. The danger rises if the module is shaded at high irradi-
ation level or if the shade is applied for many seconds. Figure 15 shows a high power TOPCon
module with failure mode A after being shaded in a long module string. To find mode A failure
or  open  BPD,  a  string  wise  BPD  test  at  night  is  useful.  Measure  the  reverse  bias  voltage
achieved in the string when 3% to 5% of rated ISC is applied. If a string with extraordinarily high
reverse voltage is found, search for some Kelvin warmed up substring with night infra inspec-
tion to locate PV modules with mode A failure or open BPD, see Figure 16.

ule with failure mode A being shaded by

Ternus & Diehl GbR.

All failure modes can occur also with arbitrary contact resistance at the cold solder joint. This
means that a junction box which is hotter than the other boxes can be an indication for a cold
solder joint. However, resistive heating at a cold solder joint for failure mode A can only be
observed during shading or with greater safety for the inspecting person within the BPD test.

A cold solder joint usually appears in a certain percentage of modules in the production be-
cause the problem is typically the same for the whole batch of modules. Figure 17 shows the
IRT  image  of  multiple  modules  with  failure  mode  B,  with  OC  substrings  resulting  from  cold
solder joints in the outer junction box. It is frequently observed that this unstable connection
appears for a small percentage of modules from the same production batch.

Even if the inspection at the end of the production was inconspicuous, unstable connections
could be found in one batch of modules during pre-shipment inspection. The voltage and power
of the defective modules are only 2/3 of the normal value, while they had normal power during
the measurement at the end of production. It is a typical unstable connection where the per-
formance is sometimes OK and sometimes not. The modules from the same batch showed
more open substrings in the IRT inspection. Figure 18 shows a module with burnt junction box
probably resulting from failure mode C with some contact resistance still present.

To avoid this failure type during production, we recommend a reverse voltage sweep in the
dark in series with the flash, EL, or high potential test of the PV module, as specified in IEC
61730-2:2023 Annex A5 a) or b) but not c). A reverse voltage sweep in the dark would show
unconnected diodes (no current flowing through them) and would also reveal high contact re-
sistances within the junction box (define max. allowed resistance in the BPD IV curve). How-
ever, some not fully operational contacts may be overseen, as these contacts are low resistive
at this stage. To detect these cases, an automated visual inspection test is recommended after
soldering the leads into the junction box. At system level, a reverse voltage sweep should be
done for each module string to detect non-connected or high resistive BPDs in failure mode A,
and a thermal inspection is recommended to detect failure mode B and C. In case of a single
failure, all modules should be tested due to the high risk of fire.

2.5  Encapsulation degradation and failure modes

The basic module design of standard PV modules has changed dramatically in the last few
years. The entry of bifacial solar cells into the market triggered a transition from the prevailing
standard glass/backsheet module architecture to increased use of glass or transparent back-
sheets  as  the  backside  layer  of  the  PV  modules.  EVA  has  been  the  most  commonly  used
polymer encapsulating material, and polyvinyl fluoride (PVF) films in combination with polyeth-
ylene terephthalate (PET) core (PVF-PET-PVF known as Tedlar) have been commonly used
for backsheets in PV modules for more than 30 years [56]. Although their technical, environ-
mental and economic characteristics were satisfactory, there was still room for improvement.
Around  2010  polyvinylidene  fluoride  (PVDF)-PET-PVDF  and  polyamide  (PA)-based  back-
sheets entered the market; followed by pure PET-backsheets [56]–[58]. More recently, new
encapsulation and backsheet films based on PO were developed, and after intensive testing,
some of them were also commercially launched within the last years [59]–[63]. Furthermore,
silicone-based encapsulants are also promoted and tested [64] .

Looking at the distribution of reported PV module failures [38], [65], [66], defects of the back-
sheet such as discoloration, delamination and backsheet cracking represent a significant group
[67], [68]. Jordan et al. developed a rating system to classify the severity of failure/degradation
modes by ranking them from 1 to 10, where 1 indicates that the observed degradation mode
has no effect on performance, meanwhile 10 indicates both, a major effect on power and safety
[38]. Degradation related to the backsheet layer was divided into two categories:

(i) backsheet insulation compromise (e.g. adhesion issues and cracking) has a significant ef-
fect on power and/or yield and also represents a safety hazard = severity 10,

(ii)  backsheet  other  (e.g.  bubbles,  discoloration,  and  chalking)  do  not  affect  module  perfor-
mance immediately = severity 1.

There have been reports of an increased occurrence of failures of PV modules with cracked
PA back films [69], [70], especially since 2016. In addition, cracks and insulation problems in
PVDF-PET-PVDF and PET-based backsheets [68], [71], [72] have been increasingly reported
in recent years. Based on extensive field measurements, Buerhop et al. report yield losses if

29

Task 13 Reliability and Performance of Photovoltaic Systems – Degradation and Failure Modes in New Photocoltaic Cell and Module Technologies

the inverters fail to start in the morning because dewy, torn backsheets cause an insulation
fault [71]–[73].

In the  following,  the major  chemical  and physical  degradation  mechanisms for  these  failure
modes will be compiled.

As backsheet cracks are typically revealed after several years of field ageing, and they have
never been observed in previous qualification and reliability tests according to standard IEC
61215-2:2021 [28], the probable origin is suggested to be the result of a combination of multiple
stresses and might also include unexpected material interactions as drivers. Similar PA back-
sheet  cracks  could  be  reproduced  by  a  newly  designed  indoor  accelerated  ageing  test,  by
utilising  simultaneous  combined  or  sequential  stresses  (UV,  humidity,  temperature  and
thermo-mechanical load) [22], [56], [68], [74], [75]. These newly developed ageing tests can
now be used to test the crack susceptibility of new backsheets during the product development
phase. If cracks occur in the backsheet of a PV system, a repair coating or tape/foil can be
applied to restore the insulation resistance as shown in chapter 2.2 of the PVPS Task 13 report
“Performance and Reliability of Second Life PV” [76].

Various types of backsheet cracking can be distinguished [69], [77], [78] and are described in
sections 2.5.1.- 2.5.3.

Figure 19: Backsheet crack types. a) cracked backsheet beneath a hot cell/tempera-
ture induced crack. b) squared cracks beneath cell interspaces; thermo-mechanical
induced crack combined with photo-oxidative degradation. c) longitudinal cracks lo-
cated beneath busbars; thermo-mechanical stress induced crack [69].

In addition, when new materials were introduced, incompatibilities between the encapsulating
and backsheet films were observed in some cases. These were partly caused by undesirable
additive  migration  within  the  polymer  laminate  and  led  to  adhesion  problems/delamination
and/or discoloration [56], [70], see chapter 2.5.4. Furthermore, specific failure modes were also
observed with new PO-based encapsulant films, see chapter 2.5.5, and innovative polymeric
front sheets [79], [80], [81].

Such material incompatibilities can be mitigated by selecting appropriate materials and thor-
oughly  testing  their  compatibility  by  applying  tests  suggested  in  chapter  4.1  of  the  PVPS
Task 13 report “Accelerated testing - combined stress vs. sequential stress testing methods
and inclusion of specific load situations” [79].

The different backsheet failure modes are described in the following. Finally, chapter 2.5.8. will
deal with the frequent breakage problem which has emerged in new large-format thin glass
modules.

Task 13 Reliability and Performance of Photovoltaic Systems – Degradation and Failure Modes in New Photocoltaic Cell and Module Technologies

2.5.1  Backsheet cracking type I: micro-cracking and chalking

UV photons can open chemical bonds at a surface and the open bonds subsequently react
with oxygen leading to degradation and discoloration of the material. This process is called
photo-oxidative degradation. Surface weathering can lead to photo-oxidative degradation of
the outer backsheet layer, resulting in decomposition of the polymer and release of the inor-
ganic filler (=chalking), see Figure 20 b). The root cause for cracking type I is insufficient weath-
ering stability of the individual outer layer of the backsheet, e.g. missing or lack of UV-stabili-
sation, which can happen with different types of backsheets which have polymeric outer layers
prone to photo-oxidative degradation, e.g. PA or PO. Chalking of the backsheet has no direct
impact on module reliability or the performance of the PV system. However, in some cases,
chalking can be an initial indication of later microcracking which in the long term could evolve
on deep cracking, see Figure 20 a) and b).

Figure 20: Light microscopic images of (a) longitudinal cracks (whole backsheet is
disrupted) and (b) surface near microcracks [69].

Chalking  is  the  result  of  photo-oxidative  degradation  of  the  polymer  in  the  outer  backsheet
layer which leads to the release of filler. A simple wipe test can be carried out to check this
phenomenon in the PV system. Preventatively, the backsheet can be subjected to accelerated
weathering tests, and then these wipe tests can be applied. Chalking is a superficial phenom-
enon and not directly related to the insulation resistance of the backsheet. Unfortunately, there
is no possibility to predict if chalking is a precursor for future cracking or potential changes in
other backsheet properties like electrical insulation, as there are no systematic studies on the
topic and its effect on long-term stability of the backsheet and the module. For example, crack-
ing was observed with and without chalking for PA backsheets [69]. Another example is crack-
ing of PVDF-based backsheets, where chalking is usually is not observed [82].

2.5.2  Backsheet cracking II: temperature-induced

Hot  cells  or  hot  spots  lead  to  local  overheating  (200°C  or  higher)  of  the  backsheet  and  the
encapsulant layers, resulting in strong chemical degradation, followed by locally cracking of
the backsheet. This reaction is often accompanied with browning phenomenon or even gas
formation within the encapsulant and backsheet, like shown in Figure 19 a). The main reason
for cracking II is the extreme thermo-oxidative stress impact from the overheated cell or inter-
connection, caused by heat generating electrical defects like isolated cell parts caused by cell
cracking, insufficient solder contacts on cells or other wiring parts, or excessive local shading
of cells in a module. This failure mode can occur with all the different types of backsheets and
typically occurs with only some individual PV modules in a PV plant. Thus, low impact on the
performance of the PV plant is expected, but the defective modules should be replaced.

31

Task 13 Reliability and Performance of Photovoltaic Systems – Degradation and Failure Modes in New Photocoltaic Cell and Module Technologies

2.5.3  Backsheet cracking III: thermo-mechanical stress induced

The phenomenon of backsheet cracking type III occurs with increasing operational time and
seems  to  depend  on  the  local  weathering  conditions.  If  backsheet  cracking  type  III  occurs
mostly all modules of a PV plant with identical module design in terms of bill of materials (BOM)
are  affected  [69].  Backsheet  cracking  III  can  have  two  appearances, see  Figure  19  b)  for
squared cracks and Figure 19 c) for longitudinal cracks. Drivers for these cracking modes are:

i) mechanical stress within the backsheet at the positions of the busbars, which is originated
already from the lamination process;

ii) unbalanced thermo-mechanical properties of the backsheet e.g. caused by mismatches in
the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE).

With co-extruded backsheet types, e.g. a 3-layer PA backsheet, a high direction dependence
of  the  mechanical  properties  has  been  measured  [58],  [69].  Physical  cracking  starts  at  the
outer surface of the backsheet and propagates towards the core and the inner layer. No chem-
ical degradation is observed in the case of longitudinal cracks [69]. However, since the back-
sheet film is damaged across the entire cross-section, the insulation requirements for the back-
sheet are no longer met and the insulation resistance collapses especially under wet condi-
tions, leading to a significant safety risk [38]. Since all modules with the same backsheet type
are  usually  affected,  either  the  entire  system  must  be  repowered,  or  the  modules  must  be
repaired using a suitable coating or film.

Figure 21: PV module with squared cracks from the front (left) and rear side (right).

In the case of squared cracks, on the contrary, an additional driver is the insufficient UV-stabi-
lisation of the encapsulant. In a first step photo-chemical degradation in between the cell gaps
creates acetic acid with a high local concentration at the interface EVA encapsulant/inner layer
of the backsheet. A chemical degradation between acetic acid and the backsheet weakens the
mechanical strengths of the backsheet, followed by a physical cracking of the backsheet from
the encapsulant side to the air side [69], see Figure 21. Serious safety problems [38] are the
consequence of this type of degradation, which can only be remedied by replacing all modules
of this BOM. A repair is not possible in this case.

Similarly, as for PA, two distinct types of PVDF backsheet cracking have been observed in the
field. The PVDF cracking type III i) involves cracks along the busbars that penetrate the entire
thickness of the backsheet, while the PVDF cracking type III ii) involves randomly distributed
longitudinal cracks that only affect the outer PVDF layer. The outer layer of the PVDF-based
backsheet  can  have  a  mono  or  multi-layer  structure,  and  the  PVDF  is  often  mixed  with  a

32

Task 13 Reliability and Performance of Photovoltaic Systems – Degradation and Failure Modes in New Photocoltaic Cell and Module Technologies

poly(methyl methacrylate)polymer (PMMA) and TiO2 [74], [83], [84]. Apart from cracking, the
PVDF layer undergoes physical ageing processes, leading to changes in crystallinity, crystal-
line  phase,  and  shrinkage  when  it  is  exposed  to  elevated  temperature  [85],  [86]  as  well  as
depletion of PMMA under exposure to sunlight [85], [86]. Due to the often undisclosed varia-
tions in the composition of the PVDF layer in the backsheet, no clear correlation between the
structural parameters of the PVDF layer and backsheet cracking has been established yet.

2.5.4  New backsheet types: degradation modes

With the increasing use of bifacial solar cells, the need for transparent backsheets is increas-
ing.  The  trend  is  strongly  towards  glass-glass  modules,  but  transparent  polymer  backsheet
films are also used if double-glass modules represent a too high weight load. However, poly-
mer films without fillers are more difficult to stabilise, thus, the emergence of new failure modes
related  to  transparent  backsheets  are  to  be  expected.  Compared  to  traditional  filled  back-
sheets, transparent backsheets can be more susceptible to UV-degradation, as light transmits
through the transparent outer layer into the backsheet core and the inner layers [87]. A change
in the type of backsheet may also require a change in the encapsulation material. One option
is to use different encapsulations sheets on the front and back side. In this scenario the danger
of material incompatibilities described above come back into play. Thus, in the product devel-
opment phase accelerated ageing tests as described in chapter 2.5 of the Task 13 report “Ac-
celerated testing - combined stress vs. sequential stress testing methods and inclusion of spe-
cific  load  situations”  [79]  have  to  be  performed  to  prove  the  material  compatibility  between
backsheet and encapsulant.

Conductive  backsheets  are  used  for  interconnection  of  back  contacted  cells.  These  back-
sheets typically have a thin metal inner layer (Cu or Al) laminated onto the PET core layer [88].
Potential new backsheet degradation modes include delamination or corrosion of the metallic
layer. In this case accelerated ageing tests of the conductive backsheets in a laminate with the
encapsulant  to  be  used  along  with  the  cells  and  connectors  must  be  applied  as  well.  Test
procedures as described in the IEC 61215-2 should be used, especially MQT 11 thermal cy-
cling (TC), MQT 12 humidity freeze (HF) and MQT 13 damp heat (DH) [28].

Currently, due to lack of long-term field experience with these types of backsheets, no critical
failures after field exposure have been reported so far. Therefore, at the current state (as of
September  2024),  no  statements  can  be  made  about  relevance  and  potential  mitigation
measures.

2.5.5  Encapsulant-backsheet incompatibility

If new polymer films are going to be developed or used to encapsulate the active solar cells
and connections, it is strongly recommended to test the compatibility of the materials with the
adjacent  layers  during  the  product  development  phase.  For  example,  it  must  be  verified
whether undesirable reactions or additive migration occur at the polymer interface between the
encapsulation material and the backsheet under stress, such as increased temperature. Fur-
thermore,  the  adhesion  of  the  encapsulant  to  the  glass  panes  and/or  backsheet  has  to  be
evaluated after stress impact, such as high irradiation, temperature, or humidity in accelerated
ageing tests.

PO encapsulants can be incompatible with PO-based backsheets, because additive-migration
upon  DH  testing  can  lead  to  strong  discoloration  [89].  The  yellowing  effect  results  from  an
undesired interaction of oxidised additives of the encapsulants with additives of the PO-back-
sheet. These chromophoric compounds, with conjugated double bonds, formed under the in-
fluence  of  temperature  and  humidity  and  decomposed  upon  irradiation  (photo-bleaching).

33

Task 13 Reliability and Performance of Photovoltaic Systems – Degradation and Failure Modes in New Photocoltaic Cell and Module Technologies

Since PV modules are always simultaneously exposed to sunlight, temperature, and humidity
under operating conditions, this yellowing effect does not occur in real life. Furthermore, en-
capsulant  discolouration  has  only  a  minor  impact  in  the  order  of  several  percent on  the  PV
module’s electrical performance [56].

Also, PV modules with PO encapsulants and Tedlar backsheets may show adhesion problems,
since the adhesion of the encapsulant to the glass may deteriorate under accelerated aging,
especially  in  areas  without  cells  underneath  (e.g.,  edge  areas  and  cell  gaps).  Furthermore,
light  microscopy  images  show  deposition  of  substances  at  the  glass/polymer  interface,  see
Figure 22. Na+-ions were detected at the depositions on the detached surface of the encap-
sulant by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and carboxylic groups were found by Infrared-spectroscopy.
Thus,  migration  of  an  unwanted  carbon  acid  or  ester  from  the  backsheet  to  the  encapsul-
ant/glass interface took place, weakening the adhesion.

at 1000 W/m2 at elevated temperature (chamber 65°C, PV module 96°C) and humid-
ity (80%r.H.). Test2: sequential (i) 500 hours DH, (ii) 50 temperature cycles and (iii)
200 hours Xe-irradiation at 1000 W/m2, 3 sequences.

2.5.6  New polyolefin-encapsulants with EVA: degradation modes

The development of new materials, based on ethylene copolymers in particular, has driven the
replacement  of  EVA.  Various  types  of  next-generation  encapsulation  films  have  been  intro-
duced in the last years under the label “polyolefin encapsulants” that could attract significant
market share in the future [59], [63], [90]–[95].

However, there is no comprehensive knowledge on outdoor behaviour of PV modules using
these materials available. The new materials caught the attention of the academic and indus-
trial  sectors,  but  additional  studies  are  necessary,  especially  long-term  indoor  and  outdoor
exposure investigations, to discover new degradation modes that might appear [96]. Addition-
ally, the effects of the long-term interaction between the new encapsulant materials and the
other module components are still an open question.

These material innovations tend to be classified as cross-linked POE and TPO encapsulants.
The new materials do not contain vinyl acetate moieties, and consequently, do not produce
acetic acid upon degradation. Therefore, PV degradation mechanisms mainly associated with
acetic acid [59] does not take place. Hence, the following positive effects of the use of alterna-
tive PO encapsulants have been reported:

●  Reduced corrosion (no acetic acid, lower vapour transmission rate (WVTR)) [59], [61],

[97], [98]

●  Reduced PID [32]
●  Reduced yellowing [98].

34

Task 13 Reliability and Performance of Photovoltaic Systems – Degradation and Failure Modes in New Photocoltaic Cell and Module Technologies

Unfortunately, the terms POE or TPO are used in a manner that implies that all POE or TPO
encapsulants are the same. Additionally, the term “polyolefin” or PO is understood differently
in the PV industry. Elsewhere, a PO is any class of polymers produced from a simple olefin
(i.e., an alkene with the general formula CnH2n) as a monomer. That includes TPOs like poly-
ethylene  and  polypropylene,  but  also  POEs  such  as  polyisobutylene  or  ethylene  propylene
rubbers. The PV industry uses the term PO for all non-EVA encapsulants based on polyeth-
ylene or polyethylene copolymers, which also contain other functional groups such as acrylates
or acrylic acids [99].

The  most  recent  developments  resulted  in  the  market  introduction  of  so-called  EPE  films,
which are co-extruded films combining the benefits of EVA (E) and POE (P). The outer EVA
layers provide better adhesion to glass and the solar cells, whereas the POE core layer pro-
vides lower WVTR values. However, as of September 2024, only one publication about the
properties of modules using EPE films [100] and no publications on long-term outdoor behav-
iour  are  available.  Yang  et  al.  reported  excellent  stability  of  the  EPE  film  after  exposure  to
different accelerated test conditions [100].

Figure 23: Influencing factors for encapsulant film properties [99].

Apart from the base polymers, it has to be emphasised that encapsulant additive formulation
has a greater influence on durability than the type of polymer resin [56], [59], [83], [99], see
Figure 23.

For PO encapsulants, the following new degradation modes have been reported:

●  Reduced optical transmittance due to physical ageing: Exposure to elevated tempera-
ture leads to an increase of crystallinity of the polyethylene chain sections and conse-
quently higher scattering of incident light [83]
Interdiffusion of additives at front-encapsulant (UV transparent) - back-encapsulant (UV
blocking) interface leads to ring patterns visible in UV fluorescence imaging [101]

●

With growing diversification in encapsulant and backsheet materials, material incompatibilities
could  also  become  a  relevant  issue  [66],  [102],  e.g.  encapsulant  -  backsheet  delamination.
Therefore, the materials must be tested both individually and in combination in the complete
PV laminate in specific accelerated ageing tests (irradiation, temperature and humidity impact,
isolated  and  combined).  However,  we  are  still  lacking  long-term  outdoor  experience  with

35

Task 13 Reliability and Performance of Photovoltaic Systems – Degradation and Failure Modes in New Photocoltaic Cell and Module Technologies

polyolefin-based encapsulants. Most degradation and reliability studies including PE encap-
sulants  were  done  based  on  accelerated  ageing  tests.  As  of September  2024,  no  cases  of
damage or failure of EPE-based PV modules following outdoor exposure have been reported.

2.5.7  Coloured components: degradation modes

For  coloured  PV  modules  white  or  black  rear  encapsulation  or  special  backsheet  films  are
required to achieve the requested colour effect. Furthermore, the ribbons might be blackened
with ink or black tapes. Similarly to other additives, colourants and/or pigments can migrate
within the polymer stack causing unwanted colour changes [103]. Although aesthetically un-
wanted, these effects have no impact on the electrical output. In a comparative study of white
EVA back encapsulants, it was shown that there are stable and non-stable white EVA grades,
depending on the type of white pigment [104].

To ensure that the materials used in the modules are stable and compatible with the adjacent
layers, the manufacturer must carry out certain accelerated ageing tests. With tests suggested
in chapter 4.1 of Task 13 report “Accelerated testing - combined stress vs. sequential stress
testing methods and inclusion of specific load situations” [79], the decomposition and migration
of pigmented lamination materials can be assessed. Although aesthetically unwanted, these
effects have no impact on the electrical output.

2.5.8  Breakage of thin glass

In the year 2023, mainstream bifacial glass/glass PV modules have a glass thickness of 2 mm
to  1.6 mm  (thin  glass).  Up  to  10%  breakage  rates  are  reported  for  recently  built  PV  power
plants  with  2  mm  glass/glass  modules  [105].  In  a  published  case  bifacial  modules  with
2 mm/2 mm glasses have been mounted on a rack and on a tracker mount system [106]. For
50% of the modules, the glass broke within 9 months of exposure. About 32% of the modules
cracked on the rack and 57% on the tracker. This indicates that the mounting system has a
clear influence, but it is not the only cause behind the glass breakage phenomenon. The mod-
ules  cracked  at  a  practically  constant  rate  within  the  tested  9  months  period.  No  special
weather event or module internal failure (hot spots) could be identified as the root cause. In
59%  of  all  cracked modules  the  rear-side  glass  broke.  The  front  side  cracked  in  28%  of  all
cases and in 13% both front and rear glass were broken. There are many confidential cases
in the field involving 2 mm/2 mm bifacial modules with a similar characteristic and an unknown
root cause. In many cases, the manufacturers have certified the sub construction for the use
together with the modules. It is important to emphasise that by far most PV systems in the field
with thin glass/glass modules are without conspicuous glass breakage.

The glass resistance against stress, impact and scratches depends on the preparation of the
cutting edges and on the prestress of the glass surface. A high compressive stress at the glass
surface protects the glass against opening of microcracks in the surface. The maximum com-
pressive stress induced to thin glass surface with current glass tempering techniques is well
below the producible compressive stress of 3 mm thick glass. Furthermore, there is no existing
standardised technique to measure the compressive stress for thin glass (≤ 2 mm). Moreover,
standardised breakage tests are not applicable for thin glass [107]. At the time of writing, there
is no standardised way to check the delivered glass quality for thin glass for PV module appli-
cations. The lack of quality control may be the reason that glass breakage occurs more fre-
quently in certain cases. Another reason may be the continuous increase of module size and
gradual decrease in frame height, which both increase the stress in the glass [108].

Broken PV module glass is a catastrophic failure because it violates the mechanical and elec-
trical safety of a PV module. Typically, the module power is not affected immediately after glass

36

Task 13 Reliability and Performance of Photovoltaic Systems – Degradation and Failure Modes in New Photocoltaic Cell and Module Technologies

breakage occurs. Isolation failure may be a first fault signal at the PV inverter. Very often the
cracking of thin glass starts on the rear glass, so a visual inspection of the modules’ rear side
is  required  to  detect  the  failure.  Theoretically,  internal  arcing  and  fire  may  be  a  secondary
failure after some time of outdoor exposure.

As the root cause of the glass cracking is not known yet, new measurement/testing techniques
for  characterising  the  compressive  stress  of  the  glass  surface  are  needed.  One  attempt  to
measure this characteristic is to use a SCALP-05 [109]. This device couples a laser into the
glass, where the present stress causes a rotation of the polarization plane. This, in turn, re-
duces the scattering intensity orthogonal to the initial polarization plane, which can be detected
perpendicularly to the initial beam. As a result, the surface stress of the glass in the module
compound can be measured. Figure 24 shows results of PV modules with different glass thick-
nesses, where significantly different glass surface stress levels are detected.

Figure 24: Results of SCALP measurements on the front glass of PV modules, reveal-
ing the surface stress [110]. The grey shaded areas characterise the typical compres-
sive stress level for production methods of Heat Strengthened Glass (HSG) and Ther-
mally Toughened safety Glass (TTG).

Since glass follows a Weibull distribution in its cracking behaviour, no specific threshold for its
breaking resistance can be defined. As the cracking resistance for thin glass is typically much
lower than 3 mm glass, the Weibull distribution moves to lower stresses. Therefore, the stress
resistance of thinner glass must be known even more precisely, to withstand typical stress in
PV applications.

Even though hail impact is not the cause of the cases discussed here, hail impacts show the
challenge we face if thin glass is used in a PV module. The hail impact test on PV modules
with 2 mm glass/glass and 3 mm glass/backsheet shows the mechanical resistance difference
between  these  two module  types.  Kedir  et  al.  measured the  Weibull  distribution  of  that  two
module types for a wide variety of hail kinetic energy [111]. They showed that, compared to a
3 mm glass/backsheet structure, modules with a 2 mm glass/glass structure experience 50%
less kinetic impact energy from the ice balls at a 50% glass breakage probability. However,
both structures perfectly survive hail impacts at the kinetic energy level required for IEC 61215-
2:2021 MQT 17 hail test with 25 mm ice ball diameter [28].

37

Task 13 Reliability and Performance of Photovoltaic Systems – Degradation and Failure Modes in New Photocoltaic Cell and Module Technologies

As mentioned earlier, thin glass cannot be fully tempered like 3 mm thick glass. Therefore, the
surface resistance against stress, impacts and scratches is much less than for fully tempered
glass.  The  current mechanical  load  test  MQT16  in  IEC  61215  [28] focuses  on frame  defor-
mation, cell breakage, and all other non-glass related features. Testing the breakage of brittle
materials, such as glass, which is characterised by a probability of breakage, requires a larger
number of samples. As we know from the field, the rear glass is most affected by the breakage.
A mechanical pressure load is therefore effective for testing this failure. One current practical
option to test the reliability of a thin glass-based module is to test about 20 modules of one
type in the final mounting position to roughly estimate breakage rates down to 5%.

2.6  New material degradation modes specific to TOPCon and SHJ
According to industry experts and the 2024 International Technology Roadmap for Photovol-
taics (ITRPV), in the next decade TOPCon on n-type wafers will grow from 29% to 53% market
share, and n-type SHJs will grow from 5% to 19% [112]. TOPCon is expected to be the domi-
nating cell technology after 2025 [112]. Cell design is evolving rapidly, driven by manufacturing
needs such as reducing silver consumption, in addition to the need for higher device efficiency
and lower LCOE. TOPCon and SHJ cell architectures are evolving rapidly with new cell de-
signs being implemented and deployed in commercial PV modules in ~6-month time frames.
Therefore, the small amount of field data from TOPCon and SHJ cells may not be necessarily
representative for the modules currently or in the future being produced.

These advanced c-Si cell architectures mitigate the energy conversion losses present in tradi-
tional architectures. Both achieve higher VOC by minimising contact recombination, without re-
ducing the FF [113]. The introduction of new materials and processes introduces the potential
for new failure modes. Furthermore, there are broad parameter spaces available for materials
and designs that can affect both performance and long-term durability (e.g., the composition
of the paste used in metallization for TOPCon and SHJ, the a-Si:H layer and transparent con-
ductive oxid (TCO) in SHJs, the number and composition of passivation layers). Thus, there is
significant variability within a device technology, both as the composition of the layers evolve
towards  improved  efficiencies  and  as  different  manufacturers  follow  different  paths  towards
optimization. While field studies of degradation are the gold standard for understanding lon-
gevity, the findings become less transferable when critical materials change practically every
six months.

2.6.1  Degradation of the front metal contacts of TOPCon

Metal pastes featuring glass frit are used across cell architectures to contact the front side of
PV cells, typically where the homojunction (i.e., emitter) is located. The glass frit enables the
metal paste to etch through the dielectric passivation and the antireflection coating on the front
side when fired at high temperatures. This approach is used for aluminium back surface field
(Al-BSF), PERC, nPERT, and now for TOPCon cells. When these cells are encapsulated with
EVA in the presence of moisture, the front metallization and cell-to-cell interconnects become
susceptible to corrosion at the interface between the metal and the Si [114], [115], caused by
acetic  acid,  a  decomposition  product  of  EVA  [116].  This  has  been  observed  in  modules  in-
stalled  in  the  field  [117]–[119],  encapsulated  modules  exposed  to  accelerated  DH  testing
[120]–[123], and bare cells directly exposed to acetic acid [124], [125].

Recent reports have shown that TOPCon cells and modules can be even more susceptible to
this type of metal corrosion than Al-BSF and PERC [125]–[128]. Evidence of this corrosion in
the metal oxide glass frit has been observed in cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of TOPCon cells exposed directly to acetic acid, as shown in Figure 25 [125].

Task 13 Reliability and Performance of Photovoltaic Systems – Degradation and Failure Modes in New Photocoltaic Cell and Module Technologies

In this study, TOPCon cells experienced a significantly higher increase in the contact resistivity
over two hours of acetic acid exposure compared to the PERC and SHJ groups. DH testing on
unencapsulated PERC, SHJ, and TOPCon cells exposed to sodium chloride resulted in TOP-
Con exhibiting the highest level of power loss [126]. A similar study featuring TOPCon cells
with different pastes and a laser-assisted firing process used on some cells showed the corro-
sion sensitivity is likely related to a high aluminium content in the front paste [129]. Accelerated
damp-heat testing on encapsulated TOPCon has also shown substantial power loss. Sen et al.
evaluated seven combinations of encapsulation material and backsheet with TOPCon cells,
as well as three combinations with PERC cells. After 1000 hours of DH test, they found that
the maximum power loss in TOPCon modules varied significantly, ranging from 4%rel to 65%rel,
depending strongly on the encapsulation material. In contrast, PERC modules showed only a
1%rel to 2%rel power loss [128]. Sommeling and Kroon showed that the use of TPOs can miti-
gate  power  loss  in  1000 h  DH  [127].  Unfortunately, there  are  limited  reports  on  this  form  of
degradation in field exposed TOPCon modules, because it has only recently been adopted in
high-volume production.

sive X-ray spectroscopy for the front side of the control and acetic acid treated bifacial
TOPCon metal paste contact interface to poly-Si emitter [125].

2.6.2  SHJ: ITO and a-Si:H degradation modes

The  SHJ  cell  architecture  limits  contact  recombination  by  decoupling  the  absorber  from  the
metal contact, by including a passivating, carrier selective contact layer stack. This stack com-
prises an intrinsic a-Si:H layer to passivate dangling bonds at the n-type c-Si wafer surface, a
doped  a-Si:H  layer  provides  carrier  selectivity,  and  an  appropriate  TCO  provides  lateral
transport and ensures good contact quality with the metal. Typically, ITO is used as TCO. It
serves as an ARC and assists in light trapping at the cell’s rear.

SHJ cells are sensitive to stressors such as moisture, heat, and irradiance, and the resulting
degradation varies from manufacturer to manufacturer. A recent literature review [130] found
average performance loss rates for SHJ modules of 0.83%/year. These values fall between
the loss rates of c-Si and thin-film modules reported in 2016 [131].

A possible route of performance change specific to SHJ is the increase of ITO resistance or
deterioration of the a-Si:H/ITO or ITO/contact interfaces. Jordan et al. found that increased ITO
resistance has not been observed in fielded SHJ cells as compared to cells of a control module
kept indoors [132]. In degradation studies of non-encapsulated SHJ solar cells, X-ray photoe-
lectron spectroscopy (XPS) data of DH-exposed samples showed signatures of surface deg-
radation of the ITO and the surface gridlines. However, there was no corresponding change in
the device performance [133].

39

Task 13 Reliability and Performance of Photovoltaic Systems – Degradation and Failure Modes in New Photocoltaic Cell and Module Technologies

Another degradation mode related only to SHJ is studied by Arruti et al. [134]. Arruti et al. have
shown that bifacial rear-emitter SHJ solar cells encapsulated in EVA in glass/glass laminates
degraded  in  damp  heat  (DH)  tests.  However,  DH  tests  with  negative  bias  applied  show  a
slightly accelerated degradation compared to no voltage applied, see Figure 26. The degrada-
tion of the cell under negative bias is shown in the EL images in Figure 27. Modules in positive
bias  voltage  or  positive  bias  voltage  with  periods  of  illumination  [22]  consistently  exhibit  no
degradation  during  the  DH  test.  The  prerequisite  for  degradation  is  explained  by  molecular
NaOH from the glass either diffusing through the EVA, which has absorbed moisture, or by
  ions  drifting  due  to  the  electric  field  when  a  negative  bias  is  applied  to  the  cell  circuit.
Na
Furthermore, with positive bias applied to the cell circuit, apparently Na+ ions are driven away
from the cell and therefore no degradation is observed. In the study by Aruti et al., the sensi-
tivity to migrating Na+ seemed to be greater on cell fronts than on the rear side [134].

testing at 85°C, 85% RH and -1 kV bias for up to 800 h. EL images show that degra-
dation starts at the edges of the cell, gradually expanding inward, associated with
moisture ingress facilitating Na+ transport [134].

Task 13 Reliability and Performance of Photovoltaic Systems – Degradation and Failure Modes in New Photocoltaic Cell and Module Technologies

The mechanisms of moisture damage are multifaceted, and have recently been explained by
a corrosion mechanism, see Figure 28 [135]. The adoption of encapsulants with a relatively
high water-uptake, such as EVA, favours a corrosion reaction of the glass cover(s) releasing
Na+ ions that, in combination with water, form molecular NaOH. Na+ ions can diffuse through
the grain boundaries of the indium tin oxide (ITO), reaching either the front or rear hydrogen-
ated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H)/c-Si interface creating recombination centres for charge carri-
ers, see Figure 29.

sensitivity of SHJ to water. The observed deg-
radation mechanism is specific to the SHJ
technology [135]. Right: Photoluminescence

croscopic model proposed to ex-

SHJ cells encapsulated in a

passivation layer at the
a-Si:H/bulk Si interface. Adapted
from [135].

However,  to  our  knowledge,  there  are  no  studies  in  which  SHJ  modules  installed  outdoors
exhibit PID. The humidity levels of the 85°C/85% RH condition leads to an unnaturally high
level of humidity in the module, entering from the module edges, as can be seen in Figure 27
and Figure 28. This accelerates Na+ migration considerably.

In the past, EVA alternatives such as thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO), ionomer [31] and back-
sheets containing Al foil [136], which do not allow moisture to pass through as easily as EVA,
have been used for SHJ modules manufactured by Sanyo [137]. Efforts are being made to
reduce the costs by use of EVA and other module encapsulants [137]. These authors found

41

Task 13 Reliability and Performance of Photovoltaic Systems – Degradation and Failure Modes in New Photocoltaic Cell and Module Technologies

dual issues of degradation by Na+ diffusing from the glass due to water content in 85°C and
85% RH DH and damage from acetic acid formation of the EVA. They found good success in
glass/glass modules using POE in the front and rear of the cells and with POE on the front and
EVA on the rear of the cells with glass/backsheet constructions. Presumably in the later con-
figuration,  the  primary  sensitivity  to  Na+  is  on  the  front  side  with  these  cells  and  the  PID  is
mitigated by use of the lower moisture transmission of the POE and use of backsheet allows
any acetic acid to diffuse out, thus mitigating acetic acid-based damage.

More recently, humidity induced degradation in SHJ was observed related to soldering flux and
contamination  introduced  onto the  cell  prior  to module  fabrication  [126],  [138],  [135].  These
contaminations must be avoided during production.

The  water-sensitivity  and  PID  in  SHJ  modules  can  be  mitigated  at  module  level  by  using  a
high-volume resistivity encapsulant with a low WVTR and low water uptake (i.e., POE lamina-
tion material), appropriate edge sealants, proper rear and front covers, and/or the use of barrier
layers (glass/glass, glass/aluminium foil) [139].

2.6.3  UV degradation of current c-Si cell structures

Modern TOPCon, HJT, PERT, and PERC solar cells frequently show high degradation rates
in accelerated UV degradation tests [140], [18], [141].

Gebhardt et al. examined 14 different TOPCon types in UV tests showing severe power loss
ranging from 0.5% to 8% with a median of 3% after 60 kWh/m² UV dose [18]. Shina conducted
similar tests with 28 TOPCon and 2 SHJ module types and found a degradation range from
0% to 10% and for SHJ from 1% to 2.5%  after applying also 60 kWh/m² UV dose [140]. De-
pending on the location, 60 kWh/m² UV dose corresponds to 1 to 2 years of outdoor exposure.
Both authors applied short-circuit conditions to the PV modules during the UV test.

Gebhardt et al. demonstrated that the power degradation of TOPCon modules in accelerated
UV tests and outdoor exposure is roughly halved when switching from short-circuit to open-
circuit conditions. This was observed for a small number of indoor tested samples and for a
single outdoor tested sample [18]. Sinha et al. found similar results for UV tests with short-
circuit and open-circuit conditions of bare SHJ, n-PERT and p-PERC cells [142].

Dark  storage  strongly  accelerates  the  degradation  of  TOPCon  modules  after  UVID  testing
[18],[143]. Heat storage conditions (85°C) can partly or completely reverse the dark storage
effect [18], [143].

The fundamental origin of the UVID are UV triggered changes in the passivation efficiency of
the passivation stack/silicon interface [144], [142] or possibly a defect rich silicon surface for
the  PERC  cell  front side  [143].  The  deposition  methods  and  the  process  parameters  of  the
passivation layers have a great impact on the UV stability of the solar cells [141],[145]. Pas-
sivation layers which prevent the silicon wafer surface from UV radiation below 360 nm, like
the rear passivation of TOPCon cells, by a UV blocking polysilicon layer, can be very UV stable.
No  detailed  outdoor  studies  on  UVID  are  available  for  TOPCon  modules.  SHJ  specific  UV
degradation shows  a reduction of VOC over time. It is attributed to a partial loss of the front
passivating layers properties by UV irradiation. This problem was historically solved by moving
from front to rear-emitter SHJ solar cells. Jordan et al. compared the degradation of fielded
SHJ and PERC modules. While the observed degradation rates of the SHJ modules (-0.51%/a)
[144] are on par with conventional Si cell-technologies (-0.69% to -0.91%), the loss mecha-
nisms differ [146], [147]. PERC and Al-BSF cells primarily show performance losses due to a
reduction of ISC, whereas SHJ devices also experienced reductions in FF, but the degradation
was  dominated  by  voltage  loss.  The  loss  was  correlated  with  an  increase  in  midgap  trap

42

Task 13 Reliability and Performance of Photovoltaic Systems – Degradation and Failure Modes in New Photocoltaic Cell and Module Technologies

densities near the c-Si/a-Si:H interface due to weathering-related defects. This results in an
increased recombination current towards the interface between the bulk Si wafer and the junc-
tion-forming a-Si:H passivation layers. Sinha et al. compared the effect of UV exposure on the
performance of different non-encapsulated silicon architectures. Overall, they found that deg-
radation  was  more  pronounced  in  emerging  cell  technologies,  including  SHJ  devices,  com-
pared to classic Al-BSF devices [142]. The authors concluded that the damage to the SHJ cells
originates from hydrogen effusion near the surface, followed by its migration into the bulk Si,
leading to increased recombination current loss. Furthermore, Bertoni’s work [148], [149] with
surface recombination velocity measurements of c-Si/a-Si:H stacks supports the degradation
of the surface passivation layer as a root cause of the observed loss performance over time.

Even if the root causes differ for all cell types and passivation stacks, the main UVID acceler-
ating factor is the amount of UV photons reaching the passivation layer/silicon interface. Any
means of reducing this amount, like UV reflecting ARC, UV-absorbing glass, lamination mate-
rial, or passivation layer can mitigate the UVID impact [142].

As the operating point in a PV generator is the maximum power point and not the short-circuit
conditions as used in the UV tests, the field degradation rate may be lower than the UV dose
in the accelerated aging test suggests. Light soaking may recover UVID for HJT modules [150].
The strong dark storage degradation reported after UVID tests of TOPCon modules may ac-
celerate the field degradation during nighttime. However, the reported UVID tests also show
that there are some UV stable TOPCon and HJT modules on the market. We can expect man-
ufacturers to mitigate the high UVID rates found in standard UV tests.

UVID testing can induce LeTID/LID effects in addition to chemical changes at the irradiated
semiconductor layers and interfaces of a solar cell. To separate both effects, it is important to
keep the cell and module temperature below 60°C during UV degradation tests [151]. Addi-
tionally, a light soaking procedure IEC 61215 MQT 01 and a LeTID test IEC 61215 MQT 23
should be done before UVID testing. So far, we recommend an extended UV degradation test
for PV modules with 60 kWh/m² UV irradiation dose under short-circuit conditions to assess
the module quality between different module products.

  PEROVSKITE-BASED FUTURE TECHNOLOGIES

Metal halide perovskite PV cells have attracted considerable research and development inter-
est as an alternative to c-Si PV absorber material and as an addition to c-Si in tandem struc-
tures. This excitement is due to their meteoric rise in record cell efficiencies [152] since their
discovery in 2009 [153], their potential for very low production costs, and their bandgap tuna-
bility  [154].  While  record  efficiencies  have  reached  parity  with  c-Si,  the  ability  of  perovskite
solar cells (PSCs) and in particular larger area modules to survive outdoor operating conditions
is still uncertain with a wide variability in reported lifetimes for laboratory samples. This chapter
provides  a  summary  of  degradation  mechanisms  of MHP-based  PV  cells  and  modules  and
their mitigation based on the work of Baumann et al. [155].

There are several known degradation modes for MHP PV cells and modules. These include
intrinsic (pertaining to material properties), cell-device-specific (pertaining to device design
and  manufacturing),  extrinsic (pertaining  to  environmental  stressors),  and  module-device-
specific (pertaining to the interconnection of cells into modules and embedment). In the fol-
lowing sections, we introduce degradation models for each type and highlight mitigation strat-
egies that are under investigation.

3.1  Intrinsic degradation causes

Phase instability and impurity – The perovskite structure of typical MHP PV has a cubic unit
cell  with  a  molecular  formula  of  ABX3,  where  A  is  either  an  organic  molecule  (e.g.,  Forma-
midinium (FA)), or an inorganic element (e.g., Cs) or a mixture of both; B is a metal (Pb or Sn),
and X is a halide (Cl, Br, or I). If any of the A, B, or X components has an effective ionic radius
that is too large or too small compared to the other constituents, the cubic structure cannot
form, due to physical space constraints, leading to the formation of undesired phases. In addi-
tion, the stability of the structure can change with temperature leading to phase instability dur-
ing operation. For example, both FAPbI3 and CsPbI3 are not stable in the cubic phase at typical
operating temperatures (-45°C to 85°C). However, a common practice to mitigate phase insta-
bility  is  to  alloy  these  two  constituents  to  create  a  stable  cubic  formulation  over  a  range  of
operating temperatures. Phase instability can also be caused by leftover MHP precursor and
phase impurities. MHP layers are typically deposited as liquid inks and then annealed to create
solid thin films. A common instability occurs when the mixing and solubility of the MHP ink is
not optimal or the ink has degraded. PbI2 can photolyze under illumination where it absorbs
light, i.e. blue or UV light, breaking down into I2 and metallic Pb among other by-products [156]–
[159]. This can lead to phase segregation and degradation at nucleation sites. Mitigation op-
tions  include  optimization  of  composition,  stoichiometry  [158],  [160],  and  processing  to,  for
example, minimise PbI2 residues or, if possible, to avoid them completely. Post-treatments to
remove unwanted phases may also be possible.

Phase segregation (cation/halide) – Mixed cation/mixed halide MHP compositions are fa-
voured for high efficiency and a band gap ideally suited for MHP/Si tandem cells. Such alloyed
compositions may be energetically prone to de-mixing, leading to the formation of non-cubic
phases or even the coexistence of different phases simultaneously. To test if a given compo-
sition will phase-segregate under operating conditions, crystallographic studies as a function
of  time  under  realistic  conditions  are  needed.  Using  a  spatial/structural  analysis  technique,
such as nano-XRD or time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS), can detect
the scale, morphology, and composition of segregated phases [161]. To prevent phase segre-
gation energetic calculations should be carried out on a given composition to determine which
are more or less likely to de-mix. Segregation can be suppressed by keeping Br <20% in the

44

Task 13 Reliability and Performance of Photovoltaic Systems – Degradation and Failure Modes in New Photocoltaic Cell and Module Technologies

case of halide segregation, reducing defect densities, growing single crystal MHPs [162], [163],
and adding Cs+, Rb+, or K+ in the case of cation segregation [164].

Ion  Migration  -  MHP  materials  are  mixed  electronic/ionic  conductors  with  a  low  activation
energy  for  the  formation  of  mobile  ions  [165],  [166].  Mobile  ion  concentrations  in  MHP  are
several orders of magnitude higher than in conventional semiconductors (Si, CdTe, III-V) and
this can lead to IV hysteresis [167], [168], photoinduced low-frequency capacitance [169], pho-
toluminescent quantum yield changes, halide segregation, and various other irreversible deg-
radation modes [170], [171].  When exposed to light, a PV device generates an electric field
that can move (drift) ions. At night, these ions can move according to concentration gradients.
To mitigate ion migration, researchers are investigating a variety of solutions [172], including
compositional engineering (e.g., adding large A site cations [173], [174]), 2D and 1D MHPs
[175], [176], increasing grain size and modifying grain boundaries [177], [178], additives (e.g.,
ionic fluids [179], polymers [180], potassium salts [181], [182]), passivation, and blocking layers
(e.g., diethylammonium formate (DMAFo), thermotropic liquid crystals like 3,4,5- trifluoro-4’-
(trans-4-propylcyclohexyl)biphenyl, CsPbI1.85Br1.15 quantum dots, tri-s-triazine-based graphitic
carbon nitride).

Thermal Degradation - When exposed to high temperatures, MHP PV absorbers decompose
into gaseous carbon and nitrogen compounds and solid PbI2, depending on composition and
temperature. In order for MHP PV modules to be commercialised, they must be able withstand
temperatures  at  least  up  to  ~85°C,  over  a  complete  diurnal  (light/dark)  cycle  [6].  Mitigation
strategies include reducing ion migration with blocking layers, thermotropic liquid crystals [183]
or quantum dots [184], adding thermally conductive materials to remove heat, and/or avoiding
extreme climates.

Mechanical Degradation - MHP PV materials are very weak/soft, resulting in possible dam-
age during fabrication (soldering, finger screen printing, lamination) and operation. 2D MHPs
are even weaker than 3D [185]. Mitigation strategies include material selection and, in the case
of 2D MHPs, engineering to increase the strength of the MHP layer, increasing the number of
inorganic layers, and adding a strong insulating layer between the electrode and the intercon-
nector [186].

3.2  Cell-device-specific degradation modes

Charge transport and passivation layer reactions - Charge transport layers (CTLs) should
remain connected to the MHP layer and be stable under operational conditions. Instability can
be caused by both chemical and mechanical processes and has proven to be a particularly
significant challenge for MHP devices. Most of the materials used for CTLs have stability is-
sues when exposed to light and UV radiation [187]–[190]. Mitigation options include choosing
an intrinsically stable inorganic material such as metal oxides [191] or sulphides [192], mini-
mising CTL reactivity with MHP by choosing a CTL that is neither acidic nor basic, and also
screening for light + heat sensitivity in the final device.

Electrode-induced degradation – Strong chemical gradients across the interfaces of elec-
trode, CTL and MHP materials drive reactions and ion migration that negatively impact perfor-
mance  and  stability  [193].  Most  metals  chosen  as  electrodes  for  PSCs  react  with  the  MHP
[157], [170], [194]. To mitigate these reactions, electrode interlayers made of Ti [195] or metal
oxides (e.g., ZnO [196], Cr-Cr2O3 [197], g-C3N4 [198], MoOx [199], [200]) are proposed. Despite
advances, electrode-induced degradation remains a major challenge. One approach is to re-
place the metal with either carbon as the electrode [201]–[203] or transparent conducting ox-
ides [204], [205]. However, to date, devices with non-metallic electrodes exhibit high resistive
losses and lower efficiencies.

45

Task 13 Reliability and Performance of Photovoltaic Systems – Degradation and Failure Modes in New Photocoltaic Cell and Module Technologies

Degradation related to scribe processing – Scribing is used to separate and interconnect
individual  cells  into  modules.  Ultrafast  pulse  width  laser  scribing  is  favoured,  as  it  does  not
transfer high heat loads to the material [206], [207], which can cause melting. However, faster
picosecond lasers remove material via a mechanical stress-assisted lift-off mechanism result-
ing  in  steep  edges  and  less  residue,  but  may  lead  to  microcracks  and  delamination  [208]–
[210]. Studies have shown that the edges of laser scribes decompose to PbI2, forming a type-
I heterojunction with surrounding MHP [211]–[213]. Using carbon-based electrodes [214] or
TCOs [215], [216] may be a mitigation method. Alternatively, adding a diffusion barrier inside
laser scribe line P2 (e.g., Al2O3, nanoparticles, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), carbon nitride
[198], or CTL [217]) to separate the MHP and electrode is being considered.

Strain induced by differences in CTE – The variety of materials used in MHP cells and mod-
ules have a range of different CTEs and therefore, when the MHP layer is annealed at ~100°C
and  then  cooled,  the  film  is  in  a  state  of  elevated  stress.  Encapsulation  can  also  introduce
stress in the cooled modules. Mitigations include replacing thermal annealing with longer pro-
cessing steps at lower temperatures [218], but adding processing time may not be feasible in
commercial production lines. Other authors have suggested additives to reduce tensile stress
including octylammonium iodide (OAI) and phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) [219].

3.3  Extrinsic degradation causes

Reactions with water vapour and oxygen – MHP layers are generally hydrophilic and de-
grade in the presence of water as the organic cations oxidise [220]. The degradation mecha-
nisms related to oxygen are not fully understood but are enhanced by exposure to light, espe-
cially organic components in the MHP and CTL layers [221]–[224]. Mitigation strategies include
encapsulation and the embedding of glass-glass modules to prevent water and O2 from coming
into contact with the device. The addition of lower dimensional MHP layers between the ab-
sorber and ETL [225], and other additives (e.g., TFPCBP [226]) can help reduce the effect of
moisture. Some of the solutions for intrinsic degradation modes related to ion mobility are likely
to help with the effects of water and O2 reactivity.

Reverse voltage – MHPs are very sensitive to and can degrade by even low levels of reverse
voltage (< -5 V), which causes band bending and ion crowding near the MHP-CTL interfaces
[227], [228] and possibly leading to the oxidation of iodide [228]. Local shunts can form, espe-
cially when metal electrodes are used [227], [229], which can lead to local heating and further
damage to the cell [230], [231]. Options for mitigating the bias sensitivity and degradation in-
clude using non-metal electrodes [231], blocking layers [232], TCO between HTL and metal
electrodes [233], polymer HTLs [234]. Despite showing some improvements, none of the po-
tential solutions have been shown to prevent damage to the cell from reverse bias conditions,
yet.

3.4  Module-device-specific degradation modes

Module layout and embedment – MHP modules perform best if water and O2 are not allowed
to  react  with  the  layers  of the  device  stack.  In  addition  to  glass-glass  module  designs,  PO-
based encapsulants are recommended rather than EVA, which requires higher lamination tem-
peratures [235] and can produce acetic acid [236]–[238]. POEs also have lower WVTRs.

Potential-induced degradation – In string-connected modules, high PV system voltages (up
to ± 1500 V, can build up between grounded module frames and solar cells under operation
[239]. Several PID tests are performed on PSCs and MHP/Si tandem solar cells/minimodules,
showing  no  degradation  at  positive  voltages  but  much  more  pronounced  degradation  at

46

Task 13 Reliability and Performance of Photovoltaic Systems – Degradation and Failure Modes in New Photocoltaic Cell and Module Technologies

negative voltages and also at higher temperatures due to movement of Na+ ions from the glass
into the MHP layer, causing recombination centres [240]–[242]. Other ion movements are ob-
served such as Pb+, Cs+, Br- and I- towards the encapsulant materials and Ag+ ions from the
back contact leading to the formation of AgI. The PID degradation can be mitigated by optimis-
ing the fabrication and deposition of MHP layers, resulting in low defect densities (i.e. I-rich
synthesis conditions), using MHP compositions with high defect tolerance [243] and adding
either additional barrier layer (e.g. PCBM between SnO2 (HTL) and MHP) [244] or inert mate-
rials that occupy interstitials in the MHP structure to inhibit Na+ penetration [240]. Other miti-
gation strategies could be used such as inducing recovery of MHP by applying positive bias
during the night to drive Na+ ions out of the active layer [245] or using suitable encapsulation
material [241].

Testing and qualification - Accelerated indoor tests reproduce the standard 20 years of out-
door functioning in much shorter times, enabling reliable predictive analysis. The IEC 61215
series 2021 standards [6], [246]–[248] are developed to assess the reliability of PV modules.
They contain accelerated ageing protocols, including climatic (e.g. DH, TC, HF, …), mechani-
cal (e.g. mechanical loads and hail impact), and electrical (e.g. PID, wet and dry insulation)
tests  in  addition  to  electrical  and  mechanical  safety  requirements  as  addressed  in  the  IEC
61730:2023 [249]. Other tests can be tailored to cope with some technology specificities such
as the International Summit on Organic PV stability protocols, as in the case of MHPs. Com-
pliance  with  these  standards  is  generally  considered  a  minimum  quality  requirement  and
should be considered a prerequisite for MHP module commercialization.

Task 13 Reliability and Performance of Photovoltaic Systems – Degradation and Failure Modes in New Photocoltaic Cell and Module Technologies

  CONCLUSION

It is recommended to review published reports on PV failures observed for the type of cell/mod-
ule technologies being used in a PV project. In order to reduce the number of failures in large
PV systems, the impact of the corresponding degradation modes should be verified by accel-
erated testing prior to their installation. For 2024, the main cell related degradation modes are
PID, UVID, and humidity related corrosion for SHJ and TOPCon modules.

From the perspective of the module design glass breakage failure for bifacial glass/glass mod-
ules with thin glass got a high relevance in the field. The more power is achieved per module
and  in  the  module  string,  the  more  important  the  safety  measures  become,  as  the  conse-
quences of an imperfectly connected BPD can lead to a fire much more easily than before.

All these degradation/failure causes are known from former failure reports. However, due to
new methods for passivation layer, metallization and thin glass, the reliability of the modules
has to be reoptimized for these new manufacturing processes. Some of the reported degrada-
tion issues may already been solved from PV module manufacturers by the time this report is
published. The most important standard IEC 61215 [6] does not cover the UVID, because the
UV test included in the standard is too short and may not take recovery effects into account.
Similarly, for PID effects in SHJ PV module types, it is still not clear how the PID test represents
relevant conditions in the field, as the influence of recovery conditions in the application has
not yet been tested. More research is needed to adapt the UVID and PID tests. For the humidity
related corrosion of TOPCon and SHJ the main root cause (TOPCon: degradation of the front
metal  contacts,  SHJ:  Na  related  degradation  of  the  a-Si-layer)  is  known.  By  optimizing  the
high-volume resistivity encapsulant with a low WVTR and low water uptake, the degradation
speed can be mitigated. However, the relevance in the field is unknown and needs more re-
search.  Furthermore, glass breakage rates cannot be detected within the IEC 61215 mechan-
ical load test, because for a brittle glass material much more than one test sample is needed
to detect a failure rate of 10% and below. In particular when optimising the glass thickness
closer to the application load, the according test must be much more precise. Therefore, we
need extended standard tests for these types of failures for the current PV technologies, which
is ongoing work.

Process instabilities that lead to unreliable cold solder joints in junction boxes must be moni-
tored  as  an  integral  part  of  production  control.  As  the  correct  function  of  the  BPDs  is  very
important for safety, we recommend checking the BPD function during the module production
and performing a module string wise diode test during the construction phase of the PV system.
If there are indications of probable cold solder joints in some of the junction boxes, the whole
PV system should be checked for cold solder joints in the junction boxes. The risk of a fire
within the service life of the PV system is high in this scenario.

On a positive note LeTID and cell crack degradation are still a possible degradation mode but
their relevance practically vanished in the new PV module types based on TOPCon and SHJ
cells, as well as multi-wire connection technology. As LeTID is reduced using thinner and thin-
ner wafers, the effect may vanish even further as the wafer thickness continues to decrease
with new technology steps. Glass/glass encapsulation is becoming increasingly popular. This
trend can support humidity sensitive cell technologies like TOPCon which are less affected by
humidity than in glass/backsheet BOMs. Thus, the shift to glass/glass modules protects cell
technologies which are less moisture resistive. Furthermore, the chemical interaction and ma-
terial  variety  are  also  reduced  in  glass/glass  module  designs  compared  to  glass/backsheet
modules.

Task 13 Reliability and Performance of Photovoltaic Systems – Degradation and Failure Modes in New Photocoltaic Cell and Module Technologies

For  future  PV technologies  based  on  MHP-containing  cells  and  modules,  we  relied  only  on
published  literature  data  to  support  our  findings.  Reliability  data  from  commercial  products
were not available to the authors of this report. In the literature, nearly all types of degradation
mechanisms, and therefore all kinds of tests are highly relevant. Ion migration is a dominant
characteristic involved in many published degradation modes, such as chemical interface re-
actions,  phase  changes,  reverse  voltage  instability,  PID,  and  metastability  of  the  electrical
characteristic, such as IV curve hysteresis. In this way, mitigating ion migration in MHP con-
taining solar cells might be a way to solve many degradation pathways at once.

Today’s  silicon-based  module  designs  must  withstand  high  absorber  temperatures  above
150°C and more during partial shading. Many researchers wrongly assume that MHP absorb-
ers/solar  cells  only  need  to  be  stable  up  to  85°C.  In fact,  the  number  of  cells per  BPD,  the
reverse voltage characteristic of the cells and the cell efficiency determine the maximum cell
temperature in the application profile. We would need new (and expensive) module designs
allowing this low application temperature of 85°C in reality. Some types of degradation mech-
anisms for MHP solar cells, such as PID and hot spot tests, have not yet been tested for real-
istic scenarios in the literature. We recommend not losing focus on the corresponding tests for
MHP-containing  solar  cells  and  modules.  For  commercial  products,  all  known  degradation
pathways must be mitigated simultaneously, as all degradation pathways have a major impact
on MHP-based PV modules.
